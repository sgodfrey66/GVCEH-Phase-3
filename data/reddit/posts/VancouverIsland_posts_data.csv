backpack project victoria bc,1adctl1,2024-01-28 20:54:39,antonitos9,VancouverIsland,Where should I rent in Vancouver island for the Summer?,"Hi there!

Wondering for advice as to where I should rent in Vancouver island, or BC in general. I'm an exchange student from California who will finish up their exchange year in ubc in a few months. I want to stay here in BC for the summer (end of April to early September) with my SO. We are planning to take online summer classes, work on writing projects (cuz we are nerds lol), and do a lot of nature and culture exploration (I'm a nerd for both and especially love nature, same with my SO). We are not into nightlife too much, and don't go out to eat too often (we cook a lot). We sometimes like to fantasize about living in a cabin in the woods if that helps at all in terms of vibes lol. We also don't have a car rn but are thinking of renting for road trips. We will probably have bicycles. We would like a place that allows us access to a lot of cool experiences (like treating my rental as both a home and a vacation hub - cuz I also have all my life belongings with me which is about 1 very small bedroom).

I have not set foot on Vancouver island yet. I have not explored the sunshine coast at all. I also have not explored much of Vancouver and surrounding areas due to school and other time constraints.

With that context, I'm wondering what yall think would be a great place to rent in Vancouver island (eg. Victoria?) or BC generally (Vancouver? somewhere else?) for a best summer experience for the both of us. We are not wealthy by any means but we can afford split rent and car rentals and activities here or there. I also have planned a lengthy backpacking trip in Vancouver island - unless my wrist injuries don't heal (I might need surgery for my wrist/s TFCC, not sure, and don't know how that changes the equation).

So, which place in Vancouver island should I rent for a great, nature and culture, and adventure filled summer experience? And should I rent somewhere else in BC rather than Vancouver island due to my personal context? Ty for any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/comments/1adctl1/where_should_i_rent_in_vancouver_island_for_the/,18
backpack project victoria bc,19dz3f3,2024-01-23 21:10:13,d3hydratedwat3r,VancouverIsland,Would love some feedback on my Vancouver Island babymoon roadtrip itinerary?,"I’ve never been to BC, and I just drafted up a very rough road trip itinerary that I plan to take with my husband in May! I would love some feedback on it, if possible.

**A few questions/things to keep in mind:**

* Ideally we’d like to shave one day off of the itinerary, but I’m worried it will then be too hectic. Let me know if you think I can condense the itinerary or if keeping it as is would be the best bet. 
* Is Vancouver worth taking off of the itinerary completely and instead just flying straight to Victoria? Or is keeping Vancouver a must?
* Am I missing any must see locations or would you make any edits?  Any other suggestions?
* I'll be pregnant (this is our babymoon)!

**Rough draft itinerary:** 

* **Day 1 -** flight from Los Angeles to Vancouver
* **Day 2 -** full day in Vancouver
* **Day 3 -** full day in Vancouver
* **Day 4 -** travel day to Victoria (car & ferry)
* **Day 5 -** full day in Victoria
* **Day 6 -** full day in Victoria
* **Day 7 -** long car travel day to Tofino (\~5 hour drive)
* **Day 8 -** full day in Tofino
* **Day 9 -** full day in Tofino
* **Day 10 -** long car travel day to either Victoria or Vancouver (whichever we choose to fly out from; I’m thinking Victoria may be easier to avoid ferry)
* **Day 11 -** flight back to Los Angeles

united southern vancouver island,19evuux,2024-01-25 00:17:41,robot-fingers,VancouverIsland,Mental Health Supports,"New to the island and my friend is struggling.

Long story short, she's been on a variety of antidepressants and antianxiety medications that help temporarily but then they stop. She had referrals for psychiatrists and completed two ADHD surveys,  both of which went no where with her doctor's office despite follow-ups. Any concern was met with new antidepressants or upping the dosage.

I believe she needs diagnostic clarity so she can get more specific medications. She has done counselling and found it partially beneficial, however cannot afford to continue. I can't speak for her and I'm not a doctor, but I think having proper medication in conjuction with therapy would be the most helpful.

I will be calling Nanaimo MHSU, but I used to work at another MHSU in BC and worry it will be similar. A lot of focus on addiction/recovery or severe, debilitating mental illness. To me, it is severe and debilitating. She has been struggling for decades and is becoming more and more defeated with each visit with a doctor that goes no where. However, I do know what she looks like on paper. She's still functioning, she's still going to work. I know she will not be a top priority until it is too late.

Does Vancouver Island have any other MH supports that are free/cheaper, but also assist in actually following-up with the persons treatment? Or any way to get a diagnosis or prescribed medication by someone at the very least in the MH field and knows about disorders beyond sad = depression? Does anyone have experience they can share? I'm compiling a list of places I can call to seek resources, but it is very discouraging.

I'm flying into Vancouver from Winnipeg with hopes to start a new life. I'm currently in rural Manitoba on EI stuck in an abusive family situation. Driver's license prohibition expired last year but I need \~5k to attempt to get it back (fines, interlock program, etc). Not to mention having to purchase & register the actual vehicle.. So at the moment I'm trapped in the middle'a'bumfuck with no possible transportation to any potential place of employment.

Vancouver has great (allegedly?) public transportation available all over the city which is one of my main reasons for choosing van, I'll be able to reliably get to work while saving & attempting to get a BC drivers license.

Today I've spent applying for various jobs around Vancouver - I have a background in heavy duty parts & service, both tractors & trailers all makes. I am very proficient in all common MS Office 365 programs; I can create & edit excel pivot tables. I've got skills on a sit-down counterbalanced forklift and can learn how to use any order picker/motorized pallet jack. I'm a quick learner and not averse to hard work. I'll be bringing a decent pair of steel-toe work boots with me and I'm not a big guy but I can pull my own weight.

***Does anyone have any advice for where I should look for employment & housing?***

At the moment it looks like I'm hitting the ground with about $1200 cash and no place lined up yet.. My EI provides me with \~$1300/month until August which I'm hoping will make it easier to find a basement suite or something similar.. I'm starting to look at roommate ads and hope I will only have to stay in cheap motels for a few nights once I get there.

Does anyone have any similar experiences with moving cross-country like this?

TBH really looking forward to seeing the mountains and ocean both for the first time. Vancouver looks like a beautiful city.

Looking for advice, suggestions, criticism, encouragement?

Thanks in advance.

point time,1absy2m,2024-01-26 21:06:28,Babebb23,VancouverIsland,Haunted/Eerie feeling from Tonquin Hike and Beach in Tofino Canada?,"
I’m curious if anyone has had a weird eerie feeling/haunted experience on the Tonquin Trail or Tonquin Beach in Tofino Canada? I’m a skeptic of most ghost/haunted stuff but this one situation from my childhood sticks out and I wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience? It’s definitely possible it was just an animal, but I grew up in the outdoors and  we all had experience hiking/camping in areas that have bears, cougars etc, and this just felt different. To this day I’ve NEVER had a feeling like the one I experienced on this beach. My family still talks about it occasionally and I still get chills thinking about it 18 years later. Anyone else have something like this happen to them? 

Here’s the story: 
When I was about 9 or 10 my family and I went on vacation to Tofino, Canada. We decided to do a short hike down to a local beach- Tonquin trail and Beach. So me, my mom, dad and grandpa started this hike. Half way through my grandpa asked to take a break and he sat down and said he didn’t want to go any further, he was older and tired so we didn’t think much of it and continued on. It was this absolutely beautiful forest, covered with moss and fog and it was drizzling the entire time we were there. Some of the areas were pretty dark and eerie looking but overall really beautiful and amazing. At one point, all of the sudden, I got this weird almost primal feeling- like I was being followed. I felt a weird coldness down my spine. I kept looking behind me over and over again, thinking maybe another hiker was behind us, but no one was there. To this day I’ve never felt such an intense visceral feeling, it felt like I was being watched but the weird part was that it felt like it was coming from all directions at once. It almost felt like the trees were watching me? It was overwhelming. I was freaked out but I didn’t have an actual reason to quit the hike other than that this place was giving me the creeps. I was also like 10 so didn’t have a lot of say in the matter. I just told my parents I was tired and I wanted to go back to the car. They said we were almost to the beach, so we continued on. My dad said he didn’t want me going back alone to find grandpa. I noticed the whole time that dad was talking really loud but he’s a pretty loud person so that wasn’t really out of the ordinary. We finally made it to the beach. Once we got down there my dad started talking really load, and then he started to make a lot of noise, then he started to actually yell out. My mom asked him “What are you doing!?”. He said “Dont freak out” but he had this weird feeling that something was tracking us, like an animal (maybe a bear or something), so he was trying to make loud noises to scare it away. My mom looked at him wide eyed and said she had a feeling something was off too but she didn’t want to say anything cause she figured she was just being dramatic. She said “We need to go get grandpa. NOW.” We realized that my grandpa was sitting alone in the forest waiting for us, so we started frantically running back up the hill to find him. Something wasn’t right and he was all alone. After what seemed like a lifetime, we finally found him coming down the trail towards us. The first thing that came out of his mouth was that he had a “bad feeling” and he wanted to leave, so he was coming to find us so we could get out of here. To our horror we quickly realized that we had all had this nagging feeling something was watching us the entire time but no one had said anything until now. We practically sprinted out of the forest after that, trying to escape as quickly as we could, but you could still feel it- something was still watching us, all the way up to the parking lot.

When we got back, my grandma (who stayed home) asked us how the hike was and she told us that she had read about the area while we were gone. She asked us if we saw the ship wreck because apparently there was a ship that exploded there in 1800s during a battle between the Indigenous people and a trading ship called the Tonquin. From the history I’ve been able to find, apparently one sailor, booby trapped the ship and committed suicide to blow it up and kill all of the indigenous people. It was a total massacre- with over 100 deaths. 

EDIT: I have actually been tracked/followed on a hike by a cougar before, when I was in Wyoming.  I’ve also been in the vicinity of a variety of wild animals like black/brown bears, grizzlies, lions, cheetahs, crocs and other predators on my travels. I can’t explain it but the feeling was different. Don’t get me wrong being tracked by a cougar was super scary and off-putting but it was not the same feeling. Maybe I chalk it up to being young on this trip and it being one of my first experiences with something like that?

\- Affordable-ish housing (around 600K, give or take)

\- Relatively decent amenities (hospital/schools within driving distance)

\- Young-ish community, would be nice to connect with other young families. Would also be nice if there was some diversity.

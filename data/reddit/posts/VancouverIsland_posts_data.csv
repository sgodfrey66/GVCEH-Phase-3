\- Relatively decent amenities (hospital/schools within driving distance)

Hi all, meet Lego!

Lego was rescued by my friend Tawni, but her older previously owned dog is not happy with the new arrangement and it's bad enough Lego is in need of a new home.

Tawni's original post with the most info was on Facebook, which I will link below, but I know we dont all use/like FB so I'll try to give as much relevant info here.

Lego is estimated to be ~2 years old, was found abandoned on a farm in Hawaii. He has been identified as a lab mix but my personal opinion (and knowing what's most common among rescues) he's probably mixed with a bully breed. HE HAS SHOWN NO SIGNS OF AGGRESSION. He weighs 55lbs.

Lego has a sweet temperment, a cuddle bug and loyal, but Tawni has expressed given his unknown background/socialization that an ideal household would have no other dogs or children at present.

He is vaxed, neutered, and was vetted by the Humane Society in Hawaii as an ideal candidate for adoption. He is still a puppy and in need of more training, but is house broken, crate trained, good on a leash, knows basic commands, and is a quick learner!

He comes will all the ""fixings"" - crate, harness, bowls, etc.

If you are interested, you can follow the FB link, otherwise i put you in contact with Tawni. also if anyone is inclined to help spread the word about Lego, it would be greatly appreciated.

I am currently working in a small office job here in Victoria. The pay and company are okay, but I feel like there's something missing, and I want to do more. Recently, I met a friend who works in the tech industry. I've always wanted to study (which I was planning to do next year), but I have no idea what I want to study. My original plan was to work in government and take advantage of their Pacific Leaders Scholarship. However, when I was talking to my friend, it felt like I might like the job he's in. I've always been a problem solver I always enjoy the feeling of fixing thing even it would take me hours and hours and I find it satisfying when I got things done, and I'm also tech-savvy and don't mind learning things on my own.

For the software dev,engineer or someone who has a career in tech industry :

If you are gonna start fresh what would be a good stepping stone?

CAMOSUN/UVIC? , BOOT CAMPS? , DIY Courses like UDEMY etc.

If you have any advice on what languages should I learn is there anything you can recommend?

What can you advice on your old self or what can you've done differently to achieve what you were into right now?

I'm not looking for a short cut or easy route, I've always wanted to change something and I know this would take me years to be successful.

We love it here, being in a primarily residential neighbourhood with lots of natural activity options (swimming, kayaking, hiking, etc.).  We're close enough to a shopping plaza with all the important amenities (grocery, drug store, bank, gas station, etc.), but still in an area with a lovely, safe community and close enough to Vancouver/Burnaby that we can get there within about 30 minutes when we want to have a nice night out at an event or a nice dinner.

We understand that we've been so lucky to live in such a wonderful space, but we've really stretched ourselves too thin financially and have left ourselves vulnerable to any curveballs.  We know we can reduce our costs by moving to the Island, which would allow us to save for retirement.  This has been a hard decision to reckon with as we're in our late 30's/early 40's and have struggled to make friends because they would inevitably move away due to high cost of living.  We know a handful of people around Saanich and Victoria, but would also want to put ourselves out there to meet new people (an issue Greater Vancouver is notorious for).  We've heard that people in and around Victoria are more open and friendly, which would be such a draw.

I've lived in cities my whole life, throughout Canada and the US.  My husband grew up in a suburb of a major city.  North Vancouver is a suburb in and of itself, but I don't know if I could go too rural without going crazy (I did two school years in a small town on the east coast and was absolutely miserable the entire time).  Our work is remote, so that's not as big a consideration in terms of being central.  

Based on all this (and thank you so much, if you've gotten this far through all this), where would you recommend looking?  Victoria proper is beautiful, but we've been reading about how it's gotten disproportionate expensive and is now contending with an uptick in crime (don't know how true this is, but that's what's being printed).  Someone else told us that Langford is basically Langley.  And that anything close to the ferry terminal is primarily farm land.  We have a relative in Qualicum Beach, but I don't love it up there and don't think I could deal with Nanaimo.

Has anyone else made the jump from North Vancouver?  What are the big differences and what did you like?  

I'm sorry for my lack of brevity.  We'd appreciate hearing any experience or insights you all might be willing to share.  Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/comments/1b9zs42/potential_move_from_north_vancouver_where_would/,19,drugs

If someone were to join a trade on the island and be willing to live wherever is necessary to get their footing, how likely could this happen? Is there a chance? Any advice or guidance is welcome.

Edit -- thank you so much to the kind, informative comments! Didn't expect so much support. Sounds like Vancouver Island is a very welcoming place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/comments/1b8ko27/fresh_start_on_the_island_is_there_a_chance/,38,camping

There are no reservations until May. I guess same as April. Are there others that might have a place? If I show up early, say on a Friday? Etc.","I moved to the island last summer, and would like to do more poking around. If there are other campgrounds along the west island ocean front that might work, I'd like to know, too. The places accessible via Victoria, like the San Juan Provincial Park have big warnings about thieves on the provincial campground site.  I don't need that headache. That's why I was looking Long Beach area. Long way for xyz thieves to go. Anyway on or very close to the water.

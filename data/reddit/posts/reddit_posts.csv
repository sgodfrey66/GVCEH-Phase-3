I have a lot experience in the bush so I’m not worried about the wilderness aspect of it in fact I’ve always been drawn to go North but I am curious about what the surrounding towns are like. From what I’m reading, my lifestyle would fit the location but I would love to get opinions from those who have actually lived and worked in the area. 

I hear drugs are really bad as well as crime, isn’t that all of BC or is it particularly worse there? 

I’m assuming that area is quite busy in summer?

Also, would making friends my age with similar interests to mine be quite hard or no?

My partner has a potential job offer for a company but the position would be in Terrace or Prince George. We're from Ontario and have only visited Vancouver, so I'm looking for (un)biased thoughts on either place. A quick Google tells me population size (itty bitty, although Prince George is larger than the town we're in now) but I'm concerned more about crime rate, health and school options. We have a toddler, so raising him someplace reasonably safe is high on my list.

We'd be going down to one income until I can find a job (field: financial banking, marketing, or teaching), so we'd be surviving on his salary, which would also trickle down to healthcare, daycare, etc.

I know there might be 'grass is greener' comments, so it's not really whether or not to stay in Ontario (he has offers here, too), it's more if we had to pick between the two, which is the better option? He needs to let the company know his decision between now and Monday, so I'd be happy with any thoughts coming my way!

This is a very long story but I’ll try to make it as quick as possible. 

Basically ever since I was little I wanted to live with my dad because my mom is an alcoholic and living with her destroyed my mental health. By 12 I started acting out since she was very inconsistent about disciplining me, she kicked me out shortly after that since she knew I was going to move to my dad’s at 13 anyway. I still acted out at my dad’s and we fought a lot, which I knew I deserved. No matter how much we fought I didn’t stop acting out until I realized on my own that I wanted to be a better person. After that we still fought over little things, which I also understood because I needed to build trust back. But for the last three years I have been a really good young adult, I’ve had a job for over three years, I bought both of my first vehicles, along with insurance, I get good grades, and I’m honest; I haven’t done anything to get treated the way I do. My dad picks fights over everything, he calls me names, and I never know when something is going to be fine or piss him off, I’m always walking on egg shells. 

I’ve moved out twice (kicked out), I came back the first time because I gaslit myself into thinking that I was making it all up and overreacting, until I was back, it was so much worse. After a couple months I moved out again after a fight over asking him to turn down the TV a tad. It was hours of fighting (when I say fighting I mean he is yelling and I don’t say anything besides agreeing, because he turns it around on me every time), he called me ‘an entitled liberal cunt’ several times, that one sticks to me, and he pushed me after I asked him not to touch me because he put his finger on my chest. I came back after that because my grandma died and my boyfriend broke up with me, and I do love my dad after all. When I came back he started charging me rent (I’m still 17), he said he’s doing it so he feels better about not saying things and causing fights, because ill be more like a renter than his daughter, its all bullshit, I’m still paying rent well being treated the worst I’ve ever been for the littlest things. We’re fighting right now because last week I was excited to show him my grad photos and the first thing he said was I’m squinting my eyes too much and I said I didn’t think so, I was being too defensive and rude.

I truly don’t believe I’m overreacting, this isn’t even the half of it. I have constant suicidal thoughts, which I believe are from him because they get worse when he’s around or picks a fight over something I know I don’t deserve. Ive lost so much weight over the past year and a bit and instead of asking me about it tells me I have a problem and an eating disorder. I’ve also recently been diagnosed with an autonomic dysfunction that occurs with lots of stress because you’re always in fight or flight and it cause lots of physical stress to your body, i pass out regularly. But I can’t talk to him about any of those things because hell blame it on me, tell me I’m a snow flake and need to just push it down, or like the one time I actually brought up that I may be depressed he said I was just bored. I can’t take this anymore.

The other week I broke down at work and had a long talk with my boss. She told me she’s been trying to figure out how to tell me that I’m being mentally abused (she’s been my person to talk about it with for a long time), I’ve changed mentally and physically and it’s very noticeable. She said she misses the happy me.

Getting to why I need help: about two years ago maybe (right before I got kicked out the second time), I started talking to a social worker and we were slowly working towards a youth agreement, but she had told me if something happens, and I need to get out I need to call MCFD on my own, a couple days later I got kicked out. I called MCFD hysterically crying trying to explain everything, a couple weeks later they call me back saying they talked to my dad and it just sounds like a normal relationship, I was so frustrated I didn’t argue or ask any questions. I just don’t understand how they could only talk to me while I’m hysterical and then talk to my narcissistic father, makes me wonder how they deal with physically abusive relationships. He uses this against me everyday, how he does so much for me but all I have to show for it was calling child services and the police on him. Im at the end of my rope and I’m scared I can’t even make it to summer, I don’t have the money to move out.

I know this is long but please give me some advice if you have any, I’m hopeless. I’m wanted for a youth agreement because I know that sometimes they help with schooling, right now he’s already using it against me that he’ll be paying, so I know that he’ll still be controlling me when I’m finally out. Not everything is here because it’s hard for me to talk about and it would be ten times long, but if you have any questions feel free.

\- Bonus that it's big enough and near enough to amenities/jobs. I'm a loner who mostly works from home, so not a deal-breaker (within reason).

I think Cumberland is similar, but out of my price range (also boomed recently). Whitehorse was awesome and similar in ways.

I've (single F w/3 kids) have been renting a house since 2020. We had pets, I paid a pet deposit, I take GOOD care of my home and there is no damage whatsoever from the time we've been here. BUT, I'm an idiot and decided to get my boys a dog for Christmas 2022, without asking permission from the landlord first.... After the fact, when I finally came to my senses and remembered to ask her, she had no problem with it. She's a dog person, she said all kids should have a dog at least once in their lives. But I didn't get it in writing. Now, (over a year later), she's asking for an increase to the pet deposit and wants me to sign a new lease that ends my tenancy in September so her Mom can move in.

We have been month to month since July 2021. Every change we've made to the original agreement since then has been verbal (me painting accent walls in the bedrooms, removing built-in night stands, landscaping, paying rent in two installments on the 1st and 15th), nothing has been in writing. She increased my rent $300 over Covid because she told me her husband and her were divorcing and we'd have to leave. So I panicked then and asked if there was ""anything we could do"" to be able to stay. She told me I could pay additional rent, and since then I've been paying in two installments per month. I always pay in-full, just not on the first.

Because of all the weird addendums that she asked for, and because of the end date to the new agreement, I told her I'm not going to sign it. Now I feel that's she's going to evict me and my family because of the late payment of rent. I'm so stressed I can't sleep. This economy and rental market is insane, and now because we got a dog I've made it infinitely harder on myself to find another place. I screwed myself, and now I'm heartbroken. I know I f**ked up, but I don't know what to do...

I don't even really need advice. I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening reddit...

**ETA**

-The house is a 5 bedroom house. 
-The landlords mother hadn't been evicted from her place. The landlord stated in a text message that the mother *may* have to move into the house in September. 
-I have the original agreement from 2020. This is the only agreement that I signed. We did not sign any paperwork about the rent increase in 2021.

Every week, or so, we’ll highlight a new subreddit where maybe you can **tell us about your favourite restaurant or dive bar or hike in that city/region**. BC has a lot of beautiful areas, let’s explore them a bit!

This week we're looking at Squamish! The subreddit [/r/Squamish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Squamish/) has about 7,000 subscribers and has been a community for 11 years. The most popular post [of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Squamish/top/?sort=top&t=all) in the community is about [trash diving in Brohm Lake](https://www.reddit.com/r/Squamish/comments/17uf3p1/little_trash_dive_at_brohm_lake/).

IRL, Squamish is community of about 25,000 about an hour drive north of Vancouver. The town of Squamish had its beginning during the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway in the 1910s. It was the first southern terminus of that railway (now a part of CN). The region's economy was originally based around forestry, but in recent years has been supplanted by tourism and outdoor recreation. It's home of the Stawamus Chief landmark and a favourite of rock climbers. 

In all, between Shannon Falls, Murrin Park, The Malamute, and the Smoke Bluffs, there are over 1500 rock-climbing routes in the Squamish area (and another 300 or so climbs north of Squamish on the road to Whistler). In recent years, Squamish has also become a major destination for bouldering, with over 2500 problems described in the local guidebook.\[10\]

Squamish also has a strong connection to the film industry, and films like Twilight, Star Trek Beyond, Ernest Goes to Jail, Free Willy 3, and Pooty Tang. 

The [Squamish](https://www.squamish.net/about-our-nation/) people are an indigenous people whose homeland includes the present day area of Squamish, British Columbia going back thousands of years prior to European contact. Their territory is 6732 square kilometers. and there are about 4,000 members of the Squamish Nation. The traditional language is *Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh Snichem* and traditional diet included fish, seaweed, shell fish, berries, deer, and geese. Squamish People lived in family units in multi-family housing, often called longhouses, and most had dual residencies, moving depending on the season.

The modern Squamish Nation is a collection of sixteen Sḵwx̱wú7mesh villages going back to 1923, following the implementation of the Indian Act.

The plumber said they should be serviced annually and it hasn't been in 4 years.  It will take 5-7 business days to get the necessary parts to fix it, so we have no heat or hot water until then.

If I go to an Airbnb or hotel, is the landlord responsible for the cost?

**-- UPDATE to help future readers --**

To summarize conversation with Residential Tenancy Branch:  
*The landlord is responsible to make sure these things are working. These fall under ""repairs"" or ""emergency repairs"" and are ""essential"".  Try to work out a deal with landlord for out-of-pocket expenses. If not satisfied with that, file for a monetary order to be reimbursed. Show the arbitrator a timeline of events, receipts. ""I can't see an arbitrator not providing something, you don't pay rent so you can go to a hotel.""*

Also looks like my home insurance includes coverage for ""additional living expense while your property is made unfit for occupancy"" so may use that, though I'd expect an insurance rate hike next year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1ar8i75/no_heat_or_hot_water_in_rental_unit/,39,housing

Our LL lives in Kingston, ON, separated from her partner and that partner wants half her equity.

She let us know way in advance that she is planning on selling the two 2bdrm units this summer and would like both units vacant to make it easier for her real estate agent to sell but she just contacted me the other day to ask if I would be interested in purchasing the 2 bdrm unit we rent. 

The property is appraised at $950k, both units have fenced in yards, ours has a shed and the other has a garage, our yard space is 1/3 of the other units yard space. Our unit is a little smaller than the other one as well. Utilities are not split. 

How would one figure out the value of the price for the units? Price per sq/ft and then add in the yard size plus any amenities (Shed and garage)?

We were looking at purchasing a town house since our kids are in university or have finished and are doing their thing, so we only really want a 2 bdrm with some green space for gardening and we really don't want to be sucked into a strata since and this property is a freehold.

If anyone has experience in this scenario or know of a real estate lawyer with experience in this area, we would love to know more information.

$475k doesn't get you much in Victoria, especially with green space and no strata so we are seriously looking at this option.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1ayzr8f/landlord_asked_if_i_want_to_purchase_our_half_of/,29,housing

In the time since I've saved up... staggeringly little compared to what I'll need, and it's seriously starting to dishearten me. I have a very good job (trades) and live incredibly frugal. I don't eat out, go to bars, or buy expensive food. I drive a '95 civic (my first car) and have a phone plan without data. I shop at thrift stores.  
Even my most conservative budgets put the cost of moving away and going to school at \~$25k/yr, about half of that rent. That's upwards of 100k for a bachelors and pushing 200k for a doctorate... which has been my dream since middle school. (don't @ me, i'm a nerd)

Is it student loans???

The cruelty of it all is that I make more now than I could reasonably expect to make in sciences without years of seniority. So either I save up now and spend it at school (which has been my strategy for the past few years) or I borrow money and then go back to trades after school, which will cost substantially more because I can't imagine interest on that much money is gonna be pretty, plus then I'm back to pounding nails just to pay off debt.

I make a fair bit more than the median wage in this province and I still feel like my goals are slipping away. How the hell do people do it, especially straight out of HS?  
Am I doing something wrong?  
(Apart from being born into a poor family...)

  
EDIT:

Thanks all for the advice, there's a lot of good information/ideas here and I really appreciate the number of responses. I'm relieved to know it isn't just me. 

Some of ya'll need to check your reading comprehension though. Everyone telling me to stay in trades didn't read past the first paragraph. I have a very decent well paying job right now and I absolutely hate it, I want to go to school for the achievement and out of interest, not to make money. I understand that what I do (which I'm quite good at) will always make more money than math and science, but I am and always have been far, far more passionate about math and science and so I'm willing to trade (lol) a better job for a more fulfilling life, at least until I'm done school.   
Some folks gamble away their money, or drink/drug away their money, or go into debt to buy a big stupid truck or whatever. I think everyone makes inherently illogical financial decisions to chase feelings of happiness and purpose. Human condition I suppose.

Their attitude gives off a ""why are you here and why are you bothering me"". During my very first visit, the receptionist tried to brush me off to go see my family doctor before confirming if I even had one (I didn't at the time).

I could of course be wrong, but I don't get the feeling that they are burnt out (however, I don't think that warrants them to treat patients poorly). In the example below, there were no other patients except me and there were 3 receptionists working. I know they may have been busier earlier, but I am just letting you know what the environment was like.

The other day, I went to the clinic, and as usual I was very polite. In return, I was once again treated very rudely. However, this time something inside me told me to speak up. I calmly said something along the lines of ""I've lived in Canada my whole life, and for some reason I always get treated very poorly here. Am I doing something to bother you?"". The reason I brought up living in Canada my whole life is because although it should not matter, I wanted to get the point across that I am a Canadian citizen and pay my taxes (I know that this doesn't necessarily mean I pay my taxes haha). The receptionist didn't really acknowledge what I said, but did act more politely. I don't think I did anything wrong, but I am kind of sad that this happened because I don't want to be on bad terms with the receptionists (or anyone in life for that matter).

I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this because it is very frustrating to get treated as if I am bothering someone by requesting medical care.

edit: I am not saying that I should get treated differently because I am a Canadian citizen, but that is one reason why I could see them treating me differently. In the past they made an assumption that I wasn't from Canada. For those who think that this isn't a rational thought for me to have - recently I was waiting at Service Canada for almost 2 hours and during that time I witnessed first hand how POCs (even those without any communication barriers) got treated differently.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1b0y1hn/are_rude_receptionists_at_doctors_offices_more/,158,poor

I have been thinking about reporting an employer that I consider unsafe. I was in an unsafe work situation (inadequate vehicle to perform work duties, almost got into a car crash and there were no other employee on site to be called if anything had happened or to check on me). I reported this immediately and refused to use the equipment. I quit this job a few weeks ago. 

However, it is clear the manager dont care and dont intend to address this unsafe equipment. He got all red when i said I was reporting this to him because its a safety issue, mumbling it had been checked and was ""in the normal range"" (of what? its not clear, but you could never pay me enough to go into that vehicle ever again).

However this is the tip of the iceberg here is an example of other things I witnessed or had issues with:

time off is not respected: some employees worked 16h daily with no day off for 6 months due to poor management, one even was crying after working 19h bec they had no staff and she ""had work"" (most are below age 25y).

an employee attempted suicide on site and this was not shared to most employees even though everyone is suffering from burn out. 

Most of the facilities are falling apart and there is a lack of resources and people. Everyone is stressed, angry and the vibe was shit. 

The wage are low and yet I never worked so hard and didnt have time to enjoy anything cause I was too burnt, exhausted, starting to get depressed. 

I am under the impression they won't do anything unless worksafeBC is involved.

Every week, or so, we’ll highlight a new subreddit where maybe you can **tell us about your favourite restaurant or dive bar or hike in that city/region**. BC has a lot of beautiful areas, let’s explore them a bit!

This week we're looking at Victoria! /r/[Victoriabc](http://www.reddit.com/r/victoriabc) has about 125,000 subscribers and has been a community for 14 years. It's [most popular post ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/pcl2y4/rcmp_ripping_off_nonviolent_demonstrators_masks/) was one about Faery Creek protests two years ago. It's tenth most popular post ever was [this cool owl](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/17z9ed3/spotted_on_government_st/). 

IRL, Victoria is the capital of British Columbia, located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. Victoria's population is about 100,000, while the greater Victoria region is about 400,000. The city is named after Alexandrina Onika ""Litty"" Victoria, the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain at the time the region was first settled by British colonists. The region was first visited by Europeans in the late 1700s by Spanish sailors who didn't stay because there were ""too many Starbucks"" and not enough tapas bars.

Prior to the arrival of European navigators, the Greater Victoria area was home to several communities of Coast Salish peoples, including the Lək̓ʷəŋən (Lekwungen) and W̱SÁNEĆ (Saanich) peoples. Archaeological evidence shows that First Nations have inhabited the region since at least 9000 BC.

Known as ""the Garden City"" due to the vast amounts of cannabis growing wild downtown, Victoria has a regional technology sector that has risen to be its largest revenue-generating private industry. Other nearby employers include the Canadian Forces (the Township of Esquimalt is the home of the Pacific headquarters of the Royal Canadian Navy), the Louvre, and the University of Victoria. 

The oldest (and most intact) Chinatown in Canada is in downtown Victoria and includes the Chinese Public School built in 1909. John Eh Macdonald tried his first beer in Victoria and never looked back. 

The famous Empress hotel was finished in 1908, commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Victoria's Parliament buildings were completed in 1897.

Unfortunately I didn't realise until after I'd already had a couple of appointments and tests, and I won't find out until it's reinstated what I might have to pay for.

Hopefully someone else at risk of the same problem will see this and notify MSP before it's too late for them! I'd link to online info about it, but I can't seem to find any.

On a related note, you should also notify [Service Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html) when you get PR so that you get a permenant SIN.

This week we're looking at Surrey! [r/SurreyBC](http://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC) has been a community for 12 years and has about 30,000 subscribers. 

IRL, Surrey is the second largest city in BC with about 680,000 people in 2024, and the eleventh largest city in Canada. Incorporated in 1879, the city encompasses land formerly occupied by a number of Halqemeylem-speaking indigenous groups, including the Semiahmoo, Katzie, and the Kwantlen peoples. It was named by H.J. Brewer who thought the area looked like his native County of Surrey in England. In 2021, nearly 38% of the population was South Asian, 31% were European, 11% East Asian, and 10% Southeast Asian. 17% of *Sasquatch* in Canada own a condo in Surrey. 

Surrey is home to several unique [neighbourhoods](https://discoversurreybc.com/explore/our-neighbourhoods), with access to urban areas, [farms](https://discoversurreybc.com/explore/the-best-of-surrey/our-favourite-u-picks), [nature trails and parks](https://discoversurreybc.com/explore/the-best-of-surrey/our-favourite-secret-gardens) and ocean front and river front land. 

Surrey is one of the largest industrial centres in BC, with a growing high technology, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, health, education, agriculture, and arts sectors. The region has strong roots in agriculture as well.

Today we're combing the twin munis of ***Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge.***

/r/PittMeadows has been a community for 9 years and has about 450 subscribers. /r/MapleRidge has been a community for 12 years and has about 6,600 subscribers. 

IRL, the Municipality of **Maple Ridge**, which originally included the Pitt Meadows area, was incorporated in 1874, and is British Columbia's fifth-oldest municipality. The current population of Maple Ridge is about 100,000.

The region's economy, originally and traditionally inhabited by the Katzie First Nation and Kwantlen First Nation, was first based around logging and agriculture. To this day, forestry remains one of the biggest employers of the region. 

The area was once home to a large Japanese population, as well, with more than 200 Japanese-owned farms in Maple Ridge in the 1920s. Some 300 Japanese Canadian families from Maple Ridge were interned during WW2, and their assets were seized and sold.

IRL **Pitt Meadows** was incorporated in 1914 and has a population of about 20,000. The municipality was originally a part of Maple Ridge, but in 1892 residents of the area petitioned for their removal from the District of Maple Ridge. 

Like Maple Ridge, the economy of Pitt Meadows has long been based in agriculture, to this day. Due to it being more low-lying and prone to flooding than much of Maple Ridge, the region was slower to develop. Over 68% of Pitt Meadows is within a floodplain and 86% of Pitt Meadows is within the BC Agricultural Land Reserve as protected farmland.

This week we're looking at Vancouver! The [/r/vancouver/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/) subreddit has half a million subscribers and has been a community for 15 years. 

IRL, the city of Vancouver has a population of about 675,000 and was incorporated on April 6, 1886.  Vancouver is among British Columbia's youngest cities; the first European settlement in what is now Vancouver was not until 1862 at McCleery's Farm on the Fraser River, just east of the ancient village of Musqueam in what is now Marpole.

The Squamish, Musqueam, Ewok, and Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples of the Coast Salish group had villages in various parts of present-day Vancouver, such as Stanley Park, False Creek, Kitsilano, Point Grey and near the mouth of the Fraser River. The region where Vancouver is currently located was referred to in contemporary Halkomelem as Lhq’á:lets, meaning ""wide at the bottom/end"".

Europeans became acquainted with the area of the future Vancouver when José María Narváez of Spain first posted on TikTok and Twitch about his exploration of the coast of present-day Point Grey and parts of Burrard Inlet in 1791—although one author contends that Francis Drake may have visited the area in 1579.

Draft map of villages and landmarks with their Indigenous names, Burrard Inlet and English Bay, by Vancouver archivist J. S. Matthews The explorer and North West Company trader Simon Fraser and his crew became the first-known Europeans to set foot on the site of the present-day city. In 1808, they travelled from the east down the Fraser River, perhaps as far as Point Grey.

With its location on the Pacific Rim and at the western terminus of Canada's transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver is one of the nation's largest industrial centres. Port Metro Vancouver, Canada's largest and most diversified port, does more than $172 billion in trade with over 160 different trading economies annually. Port activities generate $9.7 billion in gross domestic product and $20.3 billion in economic output. 

Vancouver is also the headquarters of forest product and mining companies. In recent years, Vancouver has become a centre for software development, biotechnology, aerospace, video game development, animation studios and television production and film industry.

But my parents split up when I was about 12-14? My dad has always just been a regular guy. He worked a regular job, had regular bills. My mom on the other hand… enjoys the lavish life. 

I think that’s where I’m really torn. I’m not an idiot though, of course I wish he had strived for more, or put more effort into learning more English, didn’t stay comfortable at my aunts restaurant for 20 years. But he’s still my dad. I don’t disagree with the comments it’s just not value added to me right now. All I can do is encourage him to do English classes, but he’s very stubborn and stuck in his ways as most immigrant parents are. 

I more so came on Reddit because I truly haven’t met anyone who has worked for a place for 20 years +, without education, his resume is just… very bare 🤣. 

Obviously I know things will work out, and I’m not saying my dad is incapable or incompetent. I just want to support where I can and hear some suggestions

ORG POST: 

My dad has been in Canada for over 35 years. He’s worked at my aunts restaurant as a sushi chef, for the last 20 years, and this year my aunts restaurant officially closed. He’s really struggling to find work, not great with technology and his English is probably Level 1 (that’s being generous). He doesn’t have an education, or other work he can really list as experience. 
He’s really into basic contracting/home Reno work and landscaping. 

He’s posted in community groups and gone door to door to businesses that are Vietnamese (the language he speaks). Generally in Vietnamese restaurants, the workers stay for very very long (like how he did) so a lot of the restaurants already have their general staff. 

I wrote him a resume and cover letter, but not quite sure how to guide him… I’m open to suggestions and advice! I’d like to note that he’s been at it for 3 months before asking me for help, and culturally, I know it took a lot for him to do that. 

I know a lot of feedback will be that he needs to get with the times and learn how to use email/online applications etc… but it’s a very big struggle for him. He’s in his mid 50s and just very “old school”. 

Please be kind in the comments! 

Edit: My dad can hold a basic conversation in English. It’s just not proficient. I agree he should have learned it, or made more of an effort to learn it, but I can’t focus on the should have would have could haves. I just need to work with what I’ve got. He really didn’t NEED to learn the language any further than he already knew. He knows enough to get by. We speak Vietnamese at home, and at work they also spoke Vietnamese.

The survey also shows that 15% of respondents find it difficult to know who has the right of way when entering a roundabout. This correlates with drivers’ biggest frustration when it comes to roundabouts: other drivers not yielding to vehicles that have the right of way.

So, who has right of way? Traffic already inside the roundabout has the right-of-way. If you're in a multi-lane roundabout, make sure that cross traffic is clear in every approaching lane.

Many ask me how I do it. Here's one of my reasons. Every day, on my way to work at 6am, I meet a 65-year-old woman. She often shares snippets of her life with me. In bad weather, she stays indoors. Sometimes, I see her walking slowly, just to exchange a friendly wave with me. She has two grown sons who are well-settled and lives with her husband. The simplicity and beauty of our interactions are something I find moving, yet hard to fully grasp.

Previously, we applied through Embrace, were approved, went to the Abbotsford PetSmart and chose one out of almost 20 kitties. We transferred the money and within an hour or so, the kitten was ours.

We went to the Abbotsford PetSmart again but they only had two adult bonded pairs. We applied to Embrace anyway and didn't hear back. We went to another PetSmart a week later and applied to the charity affiliated with them (I will not name them since I do not want this to blow back on me). Anyway, we applied with two specific kitties listed in the application, and heard back a few days later.

They had many issues with our application but said that if we agreed to their terms of how we should have answered certain questions (such as how often to feed wet-food and what type of litter to use), they would accept us. I agreed since these kind of things are not a big deal to me anyway and each cat is different in its preferences--I'm flexible.

Then, they replied that our first choice was already being adopted but we were welcome to our second. We would have to visit the second choice kitty (at a different PetSmart than the first) then do a Zoom interview before proceeding. I was not free until the next weekend--a day before my appointment I got an email that I was too late for the second kitty too. I went anyway, to see if I'd like any other cats there and noticed our second choice hadn't been picked up yet.

Third choice: we found another kitten posted on the website yesterday. Within 7 hours of the post, I emailed back and said we'd like her. No reply. To expedite the process and not lose out yet again, I went to the facility this morning to visit the kitty ONLY TO BE TOLD SHE WAS ALSO PENDING FOR ADOPTION! She was advertised as available for adoption on the website until last night! I understand what went wrong with our first and second choice kitties. But how is it possible that someone had gone through the whole process--application, facility visit, Zoom interview, etc. within only 7 hours? Besides, shouldn't I have been given a bit of priority considering I had applied two weeks ago?

I reached out to the charity about this. I was very respectful because I know they're not getting paid for this (or very little if at all). And they wrote a very strongly worded email back, essentially blaming me for not being fast enough with the second-choice kitty and asking why I would go and visit the third-choice kitty on my own when no appointment had been arranged.

I am not ashamed to say I cried. I feel like I've lost my kitten all over again--the process is demoralizing and tiring--I've been all over the Lower Mainland with no cat to show for it. Am I going about this wrong?

We've also been to the SPCA but they seemed to have lost our application (even though I spoke with one of them on the phone that very same day) then they refused to let us handle the two cats they had because they didn't want the cats to be scared. Which I understand, but if the cats couldn't be handled then they were not for us.

I'm also considering cat cafes but they look like they have even more applications that this charity does and I don't know if I can handle the process of meeting so many more cats and growing attached only to be refused again and again and again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1b5wfox/why_is_it_so_demoralizing_to_adopt_a_cat_in_the/,195,britishcolumbia

When I finally do get my prescription, my doctor gives me *ONE* refill, so I have to do this whole song and dance all over again two months later.

I have a few job opportunities in the following towns: Salmon Arm, Kamloops, Fort St John, Kelowna and Abbotsford.

I like nature and love activites like hiking and sightseeing, and not really fussed about nightlife - if there's none, I dont mind stayin at home

Which of these towns do you think arent TOO boring, have a relatively med-high socioeconomic status (i.e. not redneck)

I’ve tried to find a walk in clinic but they help with one thing at a time and it’s so hard in my mental state to constantly try to find new doctors, set alarms in the morning to phone clinics for appointments etc.

Health stuff is piling up and I see little hope and have less an less motivation. Does anyone have advice? Does the province BC have any services I can reach out to who can help me figure out what to do?

Edit: thank you all so much for your help! I really really appreciate the suggestions and it was actually quite uplifting and touching that so many reached out.

For a single person this comes out to approximately $1,500/month.

To qualify for disability assistance, an individual would need to be disabled in some way, as well as fall within the asset and income limits. Asset limits for a single person are $100,000. Meanwhile they can have an income of up to $16,200 before it begins to decrease the support at a dollar-for-dollar rate. So for example, if someone on disability assistance were to earn $25,000 through work, they would receive $8,800 less in assistance for that year. After an income of approximately $34,500 the individual would receive no support.

However what many people **don't** know is that individuals on disability assistance are not allowed to earn any interest on their savings. Zero.

Interest is classified by the ministry as ""unearned income"", and it results in a clawing back of an equal amount from the person's support.

So if someone were to invest $10,000 of their savings into a TFSA or GIC, resulting in say... $500 in interest over the course of the year, as soon as they receive that interest they would need to declare it to the ministry, and their next month's check will be $500 less.

The only way they are permitted to earn any money from investments or interest at all is if their money is held in an authorized trust. This costs around $1,000-1,200 to set up, and requires a trustee to oversee the funds.

This is a rather discriminatory policy towards low-income disabled BC citizens that robs them of hundreds, or even potentially thousands of dollars every year. Everyone in BC can invest their savings, and in fact it is recommended that they do so in order to prepare themselves for retirement. Yet the BC government decided that a demographic among the highest risk of poverty should not be permitted to do the same.

The province is constantly under pressure to raise support rates, since they are inadequate given the current costs of living, yet they refuse to take a step that would better the lives of low-income disabled individuals while costing the province absolutely nothing.

As someone who was put on disability assistance a few years back, and who has lost out on thousands due to this policy, I would urge you to write your local MLA's and ask them to change this discriminatory policy. It would be immediately helpful for many disabled people currently trapped in poverty.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1ashgr0/discriminatory_policies_towards_lowincome/,60,britishcolumbia

I was covered at 80% with Canada Life before the drug I take ($2,700 monthly) was added to the Pharmacare list in October. Now Canada Life says they only have to cover 50% and Pharmacare will pay the other 30% after I apply. When I applied to Pharmacare, they sent a letter saying my deductible was $4,500 (equivalent of six months out of pocket) because of my income but Canada Life says their policy is that Pharmacare is my primary insurance if I’m eligible for the program (regardless of deductible) so it’s not their problem. 

I wish Pharmacare had rejected me or there was an option for people with private insurance and higher incomes to be exempted from Pharmacare because I now will end up paying $11,000 instead $6,000 out of pocket because Canada Life is using Pharamcare as an excuse not to cover me at the rate for my plan. 

Any ideas? This seems like a major downside to Pharmacare that maybe hasn’t been considered? I can imagine almost everyone with decent private insurance and expensive drug needs will be in the same boat if their drug is added to Pharmacare. It also puts a higher burden on the province instead of private corporations who are paid to provide insurance - wtf?

This consists of a set of heat pumps that serve each floor via a Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) system to provide per-unit heat and AC.

Under our setup, the utility invoices the strata corp. for aggregate usage and the strata corp. invoices each resident via a third party billing services provider. The strata corp. sets the rates applied to residents’ energy usage in order to recover the strata corp.’s cost from the utility.

Ten days ago, the heat pump serving my floor failed. I reported this to the site and property managers the next day. After four to five days passed without follow-up, I reported it to the council. They told me that I would have to follow-up directly with the utility since I “had a contract with them” and the council was “too busy”. During most of this time the thermostat has indicated it’s been constantly heating.

In fact, only the strata corp. has a contract with the utility and this contract specifically states that only the strata corp. can bring complaints as well as the manner in which this is done. Moreover, the contract indicates that the strata corp. owns the “metering system” although this is very hazily defined.

What I’m trying to find out is:

- if the strata corp. is responsible for the performance/service-quality of their subcontractor (the utility) or is this on me to manage personally?
- if the strata corp. is responsible for reimbursing any costs invoiced due to metering errors while the system was nonfunctional or do I have to try to claw this back from the utility somehow?
- what steps can I take to find out more? There’s not a lot of info out there because there aren’t many buildings with this setup.

I am moving to BC in a couple weeks and want to know if anyone has any advice for getting a “blank slate” when transferring from OHIP to a BC health card.

I ask because I just had an extremely disheartening visit with a neurologist here in Ontario where even though I have clear markers of illness in my test results, because I had a wellness check once from a mobile crisis response unit nearly a decade ago, the neurologist said all my issues were just because of mental health problems. 

I just went back and read all my after visit summaries from my appointments in the past ten years and turns out nearly every single one refers to this crisis unit incident as the cause of my issues. So basically seems like I haven’t been taking seriously since this incident. Not sure how things like a broken leg, detached retinas, and anaemia can be caused by previous mental health problems… but I guess I am not a doctor. 

I just want to start fresh without the bias, judgement, and dismissal of doctors the second they open my medical history. Is there a way to do this when I get all my BC paperwork?

I try to ride my motorbike whenever possible, It's cheap on fuel, insurance, and easier to park, absolutely wonderful way to get around especially long distances as its able to go on the highway.

Was wondering if there ever was any proposals to allow lane filtering for motorbikes? Having to take up a car full of space in traffic and at stop lights seems incredibly inefficient not to mention dangerous. Lane filtering is both safer for motorcycles and drivers plus having an incentive for two wheeled transport in the sense of being able to completely bypass rush hour traffic would surely make more people consider getting motorbikes/mopeds, which would reduce congestion.

When I say lane FILTERING i dont mean lane splitting. Flying past someone at highway speeds is obviously dangerous however at stop lights or in under 15km/h traffic it would be beneficial for everyone.

Also it would be substantially cheaper than making more lanes/bridges to alleviate traffic if more people rode lane filtering two wheelers.

Would you suggest setting up camp at the private Heritage Campsite and hiking from there, or schlepping all of my shit down to the beach (two panniers, a duffle with shoulder straps, a tank and my helmet).

My question is; how quickly do the first come first serve Rec sites typically fill up on the island that time of year? Are the Rec sites also a little less busy than the BC or Canada parks?

\- Relatively decent amenities (hospital/schools within driving distance)

\- Young-ish community, would be nice to connect with other young families. Would also be nice if there was some diversity.

Hi all, meet Lego!

Lego was rescued by my friend Tawni, but her older previously owned dog is not happy with the new arrangement and it's bad enough Lego is in need of a new home.

Tawni's original post with the most info was on Facebook, which I will link below, but I know we dont all use/like FB so I'll try to give as much relevant info here.

Lego is estimated to be ~2 years old, was found abandoned on a farm in Hawaii. He has been identified as a lab mix but my personal opinion (and knowing what's most common among rescues) he's probably mixed with a bully breed. HE HAS SHOWN NO SIGNS OF AGGRESSION. He weighs 55lbs.

Lego has a sweet temperment, a cuddle bug and loyal, but Tawni has expressed given his unknown background/socialization that an ideal household would have no other dogs or children at present.

He is vaxed, neutered, and was vetted by the Humane Society in Hawaii as an ideal candidate for adoption. He is still a puppy and in need of more training, but is house broken, crate trained, good on a leash, knows basic commands, and is a quick learner!

He comes will all the ""fixings"" - crate, harness, bowls, etc.

If you are interested, you can follow the FB link, otherwise i put you in contact with Tawni. also if anyone is inclined to help spread the word about Lego, it would be greatly appreciated.

2. Is BC ferries the best option to take or is Hullo a better choice? And is it necessary to book for a car spot on the ferry in advance if traveling in end of March?

3. What are the better car rental options available? I’ve thought about turbo but had a bad experience last time so would avoid it if possible.

Hello,

I am currently working in a small office job here in Victoria. The pay and company are okay, but I feel like there's something missing, and I want to do more. Recently, I met a friend who works in the tech industry. I've always wanted to study (which I was planning to do next year), but I have no idea what I want to study. My original plan was to work in government and take advantage of their Pacific Leaders Scholarship. However, when I was talking to my friend, it felt like I might like the job he's in. I've always been a problem solver I always enjoy the feeling of fixing thing even it would take me hours and hours and I find it satisfying when I got things done, and I'm also tech-savvy and don't mind learning things on my own.

For the software dev,engineer or someone who has a career in tech industry :

If you are gonna start fresh what would be a good stepping stone?

CAMOSUN/UVIC? , BOOT CAMPS? , DIY Courses like UDEMY etc.

If you have any advice on what languages should I learn is there anything you can recommend?

What can you advice on your old self or what can you've done differently to achieve what you were into right now?

I'm not looking for a short cut or easy route, I've always wanted to change something and I know this would take me years to be successful.

I hope you have a good day and thank you for reading",https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/comments/1b6lkab/career_advice_software_engineering_advice/,0,camp

If it hasn't reached you yet, below is the message that is going out.** 

\--

We recognize that many of you were affected by system challenges yesterday while applying for housing for 2024-25. We are very sorry. We heard you loud and clear; improvement to this process is needed. 

If you were in the application process and you received a “time out” message, rest assured we are working with the start of your application time and not the completion time. We hope this alleviates any concerns for those that were disconnected from the application mid-process. 

We anticipated challenges with the system due to a maximum number of users that can be in our software’s application process at one time. We attempted to advise you by email on January 29th that an error message would be likely. Unfortunately, we did not anticipate the sheer volume of current residents that would attempt to apply at one time and just how many of you would get the “service temporarily unavailable” message. We also did not expect the application process to be dramatically slowed down for those of you that were mid-application during this time. On behalf of Residences Services, we apologize for these frustrations. 

If you’ve submitted your application in its entirety, you will have received an email confirmation. Alternatively, in the housing portal, there is an application status page that is viewable to students who have a completed application, which includes your application start and submit time. If you are still unsure if you have completed your application or if you have any other questions regarding the application process, please contact [resadmin@uvic.ca](mailto:resadmin@uvic.ca). We are doing our best to respond as quickly as possible to inquiries.

We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback through social media, phone calls and emails. It will be used to improve experiences moving forward.

Also, is the engineering program here any good? I've heard talk about how UVIC is more well known as an Arts & social sciences school.. is that true? And how is student life here? Is it easy to integrate and find a group of friends, find housing, activities to do?

Here's why (speaking from a SENG perspective):

* You have opportunities with companies through the co-op program that are *much* harder to get once you graduate.  For example, employment/experience (and resulting post-grad opportunities) with Microsoft, Google, Twitter, etc. are much easier to achieve on a co-op term than they are for a new graduate without that experience.

* If you decrease the course load* from the prescribed 6 academic classes/semester to the ""normal"" 5 classes/semester it will only delay your graduation by two-ish semesters (from 48/6 to 48/5), and will probably make your university experience a *lot* more fun and manageable.

* There is a ton of information thrown at you in engineering, and taking your time to get through the program helps you to absorb it all, and allows for you to work on some meaningful side projects with your extra ""free time"" (ha)

* Use the extra time to join some clubs and do some networking.  Relationships are everything.  If you get your head down and just burn through a degree and come out with no life lessons/experiences, you may regret it.  The ""best"" companies want the best candidates, and the best candidates are well rounded individuals with sound technical ability - not socially awkward nerds who did their degree in record time...

> *Note:  If you **do** deviate from the prescribed schedule (as I recommend you do), just make sure that you're figuring out your class schedule waaaay in advance so that your prerequisites all line up as you need them to.  Some classes in engineering are only offered once a year, so if it's a prerequisite for another class, and you miss that year's offering of it due to poor planning - you're in a tough spot (ask me how I know).

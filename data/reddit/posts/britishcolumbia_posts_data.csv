All Canadians should be treated equally.

The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, doesn't allow picking and choosing who gets a benefit under the law.  This applies to government policies and programs.

15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability


Eligibility criteria for the homelessness prevention program. 


Am I eligible?
To be eligible, you (or someone you know) are at immediate risk of homelessness. This includes:

- Youth transitioning out of foster care

- Women who have experienced violence or are at risk of violence

- Individuals leaving the correctional or hospital systems

- Individuals of Indigenous descent


How can services be offered to some in need and not others?



Prevention will cost far less than spending money on outreach workers, emergency services, hospital and medical expenses.



Services
If you are eligible and approved, the rent supplement can assist with:

- Your rent

- Your damage deposit

- Costs that help you secure housing (for example, getting identification)

- Transportation to a housing opportunity

- Storage for your belongings as you wait to move into a new home

- Ensuring access to utilities (for example, heat and water)

- Moving expenses

- Home start-up items


I say expand eligibility criteria to everyone in BC who is homeless or about to become homeless.   Health care is universal, so this should be as well.  Then the number of people who become homeless every year will drop considerably.  

No one deserves to be homeless not when we can prevent it.  The human cost of people becoming homeless can also be prevented, it's our choice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/19a04u2/homelessness_in_bc_can_be_prevented_bc_housing/,80

This is a very long story but I’ll try to make it as quick as possible. 

Basically ever since I was little I wanted to live with my dad because my mom is an alcoholic and living with her destroyed my mental health. By 12 I started acting out since she was very inconsistent about disciplining me, she kicked me out shortly after that since she knew I was going to move to my dad’s at 13 anyway. I still acted out at my dad’s and we fought a lot, which I knew I deserved. No matter how much we fought I didn’t stop acting out until I realized on my own that I wanted to be a better person. After that we still fought over little things, which I also understood because I needed to build trust back. But for the last three years I have been a really good young adult, I’ve had a job for over three years, I bought both of my first vehicles, along with insurance, I get good grades, and I’m honest; I haven’t done anything to get treated the way I do. My dad picks fights over everything, he calls me names, and I never know when something is going to be fine or piss him off, I’m always walking on egg shells. 

I’ve moved out twice (kicked out), I came back the first time because I gaslit myself into thinking that I was making it all up and overreacting, until I was back, it was so much worse. After a couple months I moved out again after a fight over asking him to turn down the TV a tad. It was hours of fighting (when I say fighting I mean he is yelling and I don’t say anything besides agreeing, because he turns it around on me every time), he called me ‘an entitled liberal cunt’ several times, that one sticks to me, and he pushed me after I asked him not to touch me because he put his finger on my chest. I came back after that because my grandma died and my boyfriend broke up with me, and I do love my dad after all. When I came back he started charging me rent (I’m still 17), he said he’s doing it so he feels better about not saying things and causing fights, because ill be more like a renter than his daughter, its all bullshit, I’m still paying rent well being treated the worst I’ve ever been for the littlest things. We’re fighting right now because last week I was excited to show him my grad photos and the first thing he said was I’m squinting my eyes too much and I said I didn’t think so, I was being too defensive and rude.

I truly don’t believe I’m overreacting, this isn’t even the half of it. I have constant suicidal thoughts, which I believe are from him because they get worse when he’s around or picks a fight over something I know I don’t deserve. Ive lost so much weight over the past year and a bit and instead of asking me about it tells me I have a problem and an eating disorder. I’ve also recently been diagnosed with an autonomic dysfunction that occurs with lots of stress because you’re always in fight or flight and it cause lots of physical stress to your body, i pass out regularly. But I can’t talk to him about any of those things because hell blame it on me, tell me I’m a snow flake and need to just push it down, or like the one time I actually brought up that I may be depressed he said I was just bored. I can’t take this anymore.

The other week I broke down at work and had a long talk with my boss. She told me she’s been trying to figure out how to tell me that I’m being mentally abused (she’s been my person to talk about it with for a long time), I’ve changed mentally and physically and it’s very noticeable. She said she misses the happy me.

Getting to why I need help: about two years ago maybe (right before I got kicked out the second time), I started talking to a social worker and we were slowly working towards a youth agreement, but she had told me if something happens, and I need to get out I need to call MCFD on my own, a couple days later I got kicked out. I called MCFD hysterically crying trying to explain everything, a couple weeks later they call me back saying they talked to my dad and it just sounds like a normal relationship, I was so frustrated I didn’t argue or ask any questions. I just don’t understand how they could only talk to me while I’m hysterical and then talk to my narcissistic father, makes me wonder how they deal with physically abusive relationships. He uses this against me everyday, how he does so much for me but all I have to show for it was calling child services and the police on him. Im at the end of my rope and I’m scared I can’t even make it to summer, I don’t have the money to move out.

I know this is long but please give me some advice if you have any, I’m hopeless. I’m wanted for a youth agreement because I know that sometimes they help with schooling, right now he’s already using it against me that he’ll be paying, so I know that he’ll still be controlling me when I’m finally out. Not everything is here because it’s hard for me to talk about and it would be ten times long, but if you have any questions feel free.

We're not opposed to financing and then selling in a couple of years either, but we need to make sure we don't end up underwater on the car if we do a super long finance. 

Has anyone leased from Nissan? Ideally Campus Nissan in Victoria? 

I've read nightmare stories about dealerships charging thousands of fees that weren't listed in the contract to return the car at the end of lease, and thousands if you want to buy it too. 

Nissan no longer allows 3rd party sales, so you either buy it and pay their fees or sell it to them and pay these fees. 

Most of these stories are coming out of the US, but some have been Canadian. There have been lawsuits in the US about it, so it's gotten a bit out of hand it seems. 

I'd love to hear personal stories of dealing with Nissan in terms of Leasing. 

We don't mind if at the end of the day a lease cost us 2k more than a finance over the course of 3 years, but I definitely mind if that 2k becomes 5k+ when you go to return the car! 

I also found it impossible to get actual numbers for them foe the various insurance packages on a lease. So I'd like to know how much more a month those may have run people, depending on what you chose at the time.

first peoples victoria,1anw2in,2024-02-11 01:27:06,Intelligent_Tour3148,britishcolumbia,There is not a shortage of doctors.,"My take as a medical student. There is not a shortage of doctors. Just a shortage of training positions.

Some background information:  
After completing medical school, a person is technically a doctor, but they are not able to practice medicine until they complete residency training. Residency training varies in length and it is essentially on the job training for someone to become a specific type of doctor (ex. family doctor, paediatrician, surgeon, neurologist, etc.). In the medical community, the term IMG stands for ""International Medical Graduate"". There are two types of IMGs: 1.Foreigners who studied and became fully practicing doctors in their home countries and then immigrate to Canada. 2. Canadian citizens who go to accredited medical schools outside of Canada. My post is about the second type.

I am BC born and raised. I am currently studying at a top medical school in Scotland with desires of returning to BC for residency training. No, I did not move to Scotland because I ""wasn't smart enough to get in"" in Canada. For various family reasons, I chose to study in Scotland and never actually applied in Canada. Enough about me.

Every year, thousands of extremely smart and qualified people get rejected from medical schools in Canada. Many of these people would make excellent doctors, but the limited seats makes the process insanely competitive. Hundreds, if not thousands of these students choose to study medicine at accredited, reputable universities across the world with the hopes of returning to practice in Canada.

After graduating, most apply for residency training in Canada in order to allow them to actually practice in Canada. The real shortage is with the lack of residency training spots. Students who graduate from Canadian medical schools are given first dibs on residency training spots. Generally speaking, the leftover, less desirable, vacant positions are then opened up for Canadian students who graduated from foreign medical schools to apply to. There is no preference given based on where you studied. A Canadian who graduated from medical school in Australia will be treated the same as a graduate from India or the Carribean. Unfortunately, again, there are far more highly qualified applicants than positions. After getting rejected from residency training in Canada, many of these students will do residency training in the US (easier to get a spot) or just stay in whatever country they studied in, and then probably settle there permanently. 

I agree with the practice of students who graduate from Canadian schools getting first dibs on spots. Regardless of that though, there are many qualified doctors trying to get training in Canada who get rejected due to a lack of those residency training spots. All four Canadians I know who graduated from top medical schools in England were rejected from residency training in Canada and forced to train in the US instead. After training they all decided to stay in the US for the better pay and cost of living.

Many Canadians are against the idea of having a doctor who trained in a foreign country. Understandable. Do know that Canadians who studied abroad and are seeking residency training in Canada went to accredited medical schools and write the exam same board exams as Canadian medical school graduates do. The standards are the same. Until more Canadian medical schools are built, the system is dependent on Canadians going abroad for medical training to take the less desirable residency training spots in less desirable communities.

To sum it up, there is no shortage of Canadian doctors. There is a shortage of residency training spots. The solution is to create more residency training spots. I have no idea what that would entail. We can create more Canadian medical schools but that will take time and still require the development of more residency spots. The alternative is continuing with this doctor shortage or giving physician responsibilities to other professions like nurses and pharmacists.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1anw2in/there_is_not_a_shortage_of_doctors/,192

I thought I’d add something a little more positive to the mix. It’s admittedly anecdotal, but so is a lot of the negative talk. I’m in Metro Vancouver.

I haven’t had a family GP for about three years, after my doc uprooted and moved to another town. I signed up for the “need a doctor” registry last April after seeing it mentioned in this subreddit (I think). As of the middle of this month I have a new GP. She’s attentive, pleasant and in her mid-30s I would guess. She spent almost 20 minutes with me on my first visit and I did not feel rushed. While nine months is a long time to wait for a family doctor, I’m just glad I have one now.

Also, last summer I was given a referral to a specialist by a telemedicine doctor (I used a telemed app to sub for a family physician while I waited). I saw the specialist six weeks later and was booked for a minor surgery this month. The surgery was done without a hitch. Despite the supply and demand curves for medical care being way out of control in this province, during the five hours total I spent in the hospital I feel I have never been better cared for. The nurses were all personable, they understood my anxiety (general anaesthesia is weeeeird man), and I never felt forgotten or ignored. My anaesthetist was hysterically funny and my surgeon was cucumber-cool. They were all total pros and the surgery machine ticked like clockwork.

So while our healthcare engine is overworked and is struggling to keep up with the demand, all of the components are top-notch quality and working like mad. I feel fortunate we have the kind of people in our healthcare system that we seem to.

Prince George's population is estimated at about 87,000, and nearly 100,000 in the broader region. It is often called the province's ""northern capital"". It is situated at the confluence of the Fraser and Nechako rivers.

First established as a trading post in 1807 by Simon Fraser, the post was centred in the centuries-old homeland of the Lheidli T'enneh First Nation, whose name means ""people of the confluence of the two rivers."" It was historically referred to as Fort George Indian Band.

The city was incorporated in 1915 and maintained a small population until after WW2 when the The Pacific Great Eastern railway finally made its way to the community, connecting with the CN line. 

In 1964 the first pulp mill, Prince George Pulp and Paper was built, followed by two more in 1966. Forestry dominated the local economy throughout the 20th century, including plywood manufacture, numerous sawmills and three pulp&pellet mills as major employers and customers. Prince George is home to the College of New Caledonia.

Wondering for advice as to where I should rent in BC generally for the summer. I'm an exchange student from California who will finish up their exchange year in ubc in a few months. I want to stay here in BC for the summer (end of April to early September) with my SO. We are planning to take online summer classes, work on writing projects (cuz we are nerds lol), and do a lot of nature and culture exploration (I'm a nerd for both and especially love nature, same with my SO). We are not into nightlife too much, and don't go out to eat too often (we cook a lot). We sometimes like to fantasize about living in a cabin in the woods if that helps at all in terms of vibes lol. We also don't have a car rn but are thinking of renting for road trips. We will probably have bicycles. We would like a place that allows us access to a lot of cool experiences (like treating my rental as both a home and a vacation hub - cuz I also have all my life belongings with me which is about 1 very small bedroom).

I have not set foot on Vancouver island yet. I have not explored the sunshine coast at all. I also have not explored much of Vancouver and surrounding areas due to school and other time constraints.

With that context, I'm wondering what yall think would be a great place to rent in BC? Some place in Vancouver island (eg. Victoria?)? Vancouver? Someplace specific in Sunshine Coast? somewhere else? for a best summer experience for the both of us. We are not wealthy by any means but we can afford split rent and car rentals and activities here or there. I also have planned a lengthy backpacking trip in Vancouver island - unless my wrist injuries don't heal (I might need surgery for my wrist/s TFCC, not sure, and don't know how that changes the equation).

So, which place in BC should I rent for a great, nature and culture, and adventure filled summer experience? Ty for any advice!

I would love some feedback on it, if possible.

**A few questions/things to keep in mind:**

* Ideally we’d like to shave one day off of the itinerary, but I’m worried it will then be too hectic. Let me know if you think I can condense the itinerary or if keeping it as is would be the best bet.
* Is Vancouver worth taking off of the itinerary completely and instead just flying straight to Victoria? Or is keeping Vancouver a must?
* Am I missing any must see locations or would you make any edits? Any other suggestions?
* I'll be pregnant (this is our babymoon)!

**Rough draft itinerary:**

* **Day 1 -** flight from Los Angeles to Vancouver
* **Day 2 -** full day in Vancouver
* **Day 3 -** full day in Vancouver
* **Day 4 -** travel day to Victoria (car & ferry)
* **Day 5 -** full day in Victoria
* **Day 6 -** full day in Victoria
* **Day 7 -** long car travel day to Tofino (\~5 hour drive)
* **Day 8 -** full day in Tofino
* **Day 9 -** full day in Tofino
* **Day 10 -** long car travel day to either Victoria or Vancouver (whichever we choose to fly out from; I’m thinking Victoria may be easier to avoid ferry)
* **Day 11 -** flight back to Los Angeles

tourism vancouver island,1ag0tmv,2024-02-01 03:05:51,DependentCalm5095,britishcolumbia,"Thinking/Considering to move to semi off grid living BC from Montreal, QC","Hello dear fellow people,

Another 23589647th post about moving to BC. 

Alright so this is the backstory, This is going to be a little long read;

So,

Been thinking about moving to BC from Montreal in the last few months, however this post might be different from previous topics posted here because the goal is kind of pretty different and specific;

Although Montreal is relatively kind of ""cheap"" and 'affordable"" compared to the ROC however rents here have been skyrocketing like crazy and it's getting pretty bad too here IMHO. You can still get some cheap gems however it's getting rarer and rarer by the year.

Also been pretty lonely in the last few years, stopped talking/hanging out to some people that were considered as ""friends"" (more like acquaintances tbh) because on how they are ""busy"" with things and how friend/relationships and cliqueyness work here and also how COVID made them act in very strange ways. It's not completely all dark and bleak here but overtime it's taking a toll.

And I don't know why, before covid the city was really vibrant and fun to live but now post covid things have changed and are not the same anymore, it's like things are getting ugly and mundane all the sudden. It might be also an age thing as well like getting older. Inflation plays a role too.

So for that matter, living in a small town/on a remote land close to a lake/the ocean would bring peace and quietness.

It would be a move to some small towns/remote vacant land with little to no diversity outside the lower Mainland, so no cities from Vancouver until the Kamloops/Kelowna area the main reasons would be not to be around people and have a peace of mind and to live kind of secluded from the rest of the world and live in semi-autarchy and rely on almost nobody and do stuff like planting /harvesting fruits and vegetables /weed/mushrooms, own a shotgun for self defense and drive a F150, live with a woman and a dog/cat with that comes with it and not be bothered by anybody and be close to the outdoor (parks, ocean, beaches,...) The ideal dream would be going to some small towns like Nelson or Tofino for example with some good communities nearby.

It'd be mostly Vancouver Island (The northern part of BC would be a turnoff as it would be way too secluded and far from the ocean). There's also the Kootenay Lake area that looks pretty nice and can be taken in consideration.

More likely to buy some small vacant land and build a cabin on it potentially. Sadly I don't have a lot of experience/skills in construction but twilling to learn.

About me: late 20s francophone immigrant from Europe who's been living in the country for quite a few years. Single no kids, trying to save as much money as possible.

Jobwise, it would be with a remote job so that wouldn't be an issue regarding bills and expenses but could rethink and reconsider another career path such as trades at some point, there are thoughts about living off the land but that's a whole other level of hardcore living.

Fully aware of the cost living in BC is abysmal (especially real estate) there, however with this lifestyle it might potentially be feasible somehow as expenses would be reduced and it could be the only way to own a home in this country.

There are some concerns and questions though;

People in BC are polite and chill but also passive/passive-aggressive but they sound to be cliquey and sound to be not very accepting to foreigners. How hard is it to make friends there? Isn't there a big NIMBYism mindset in that area?

Since I'm a francophone from Europe, would that cause a problem? Used to live in Toronto and got some snarky remarks at times. Here in Montreal, it's okayish.   
Also you might find this a little silly, but would it be possible to access some services in French (ie healthcare)?

Do people tend to bring American style identity politics to conversations quite a lot?

How is dating overall in BC? For sure options would be limited when you live in secluded areas for sure but how's that different from the east coast?

What about crime? someone from my home country got murdered while on a roadtrip westward to Vancouver.

How about the healthcare situation? Do you have to wait for hours in the ER to see someone? Does it also take months to see a doctor/specialist? Is there good quality care though?

And then the wildfires? It really looked completely insane after having looked online and living close to a fire hazard area in the summer would be pretty worrying as it could burn down your house/cabin.   
With all the health related problems it would cause as well.

Are there any people in this group that are currently living this lifestyle and wouldn't mind sharing a little bit?

Before you guys go comment and are like ""don't come here it's too expensive"" that's useless and and am fully aware regarding the cost of living there beforehand.

For the record, it's still being thought out and this move might happen within the next few years and is subject to change. You still have to learn on how to build and plan accordingly.

Plan on going on a roadtrip and live there for 6 months at least in about a year to taste the water (never been out west before).

My partner of 4 years and I are about to graduate with our engineering degrees from UBC - him mechanical, myself electrical. I'm definitely headed into utilities, he's undecided but is happy with anything that involves CAD.

The only other stations I could've heard it on were 94.5 The Beat (now called Virgin Radio) or 95.3 Virgin Radio (now called Z), as those stations were the only ones my parents would play in the car besides JRFM. JRFM was on the most, so I'm assuming I heard this commercial on there. If it also helps, we were driving in the Surrey area when I heard the commercial.

Now, the commercial: All the commercials beforehand were upbeat with jingles or holiday slogans, advertising products or car dealerships. Suddenly, it cut to a commercial with no background music, just someone talking, who I remember as a male voice. He described a young girl who was either deaf or blind (I can't remember, but it was one of those). He went on to tell a tale about how this girl was riding her schoolbus one day, only to have it catch on fire. She, in some way, saved many of her classmates lives from the fire. I can't remember HOW she saved their lives, but the commercial ended with the man saying something like ""She saved all her classmates that day"". Overall, the commercial gave off the vibes of a more haunting ""Heritage Minutes"" style of PSA. I remember it scared the shit out of me, randomly hearing about a schoolbus fire on Christmas Day on the country music station. It left a bad feeling on me for the rest of Christmas, and haunted me for a while after. I don't know why I found it so creepy: maybe the fact that it was about a schoolbus fire (I had an awful fear of house fires when I was younger), or the stern voice of the man narrating mixed with no music or sound effects whatsoever. 
I heard this commercial once and never again. Nobody I know remembers hearing it, not even my family who was in the car with me that day. It wasn't the news. It's not a ""Heritage Minute"" PSA to my knowledge, despite the similar setups. I cannot find anything about a deaf or blind girl saving classmates in a schoolbus fire from pre-2010s in Canada. I know this wasn't just a dream, because it creeped me out so much that Christmas. If anyone knows where I could find this radio commercial, or even the story it was based on, that would be much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/19f16b1/help_me_find_a_creepy_radio_commercial_that_aired/,20

There are a lot of trades that we are not familiar with. Teen doesn't have any experience with much yet as is on the Autism Spectrum (high-functioning) and will need some help/guidance/support for prep and planning so would like to start researching early to help job shadowing, developing some prelim knowledge (ie to see if really enjoys it) . Teen  likes hands-on work, likes learning about tools, likes setting up things (ie/ tvs/audio/internet/wires etc) , he is  taking robotics class in school and loves it. Also likes learning about computers, and is joining a learn to code club this coming week. He also is also expressing interest in learning how to cook, for lawn mowing (as in teen work), learning to fix motors, learning more about electronics (his older brother is a 3rd year Electrical apprentice, but he lives out of the home).He mtn bikes a little, and is good for fixing something that goes wrong on it (tires/chains, etc). So has more of an interest in figuring out how to fix things and make them work. Math is okay however some of the more complex wordy  prblems are sometimes confusing but often due to how it is presented to him. Teen is very caring and helpful, and responsible. Things that are black and white are better (broken-fixed) rather than uncertain if meets expectations (ie cooking something, someone else judging it). Would be good installing things. Very good fine motor, and athletic kid but doesn't like ""book work"" so much because it's ...boring. haha.

What I was curious about:
Should be get some different parts and things to see if teen likes putting things together , taking apart or fixing etc? Is there anything you can recommend to do for at home for ""fun"" figuring it out? Type of teen that can just put things together but needs to know how to use certain tools, and know supplies to do it. I'm open to getting things to help learn at home. I was thinking of plumbing, desktop computer, small motors of broken things, what about electrical (we have snap circuit games lol)...part of the issue is that I don't know what supplies and tools to get (even small things, as I'm not very fixity/handy as his mom). 


Beginning at 15 you can try to get employment part-time outside of school to earn work experience (says ITA trade employer...but I'm not sure what that means) and thought maybe he could try at a mechanic shop, or?

I have just finished seeing another specialist, that I waited over a YEAR for an MRI but got no call, so I paid $900 out of pocket to get it done privately to speed up the process. Then waited another year just to be told I'll have to see another type of specialist. I was given a name, but no referral. I'll have to book myself. And that is after I have seen already 5 different specialists who just keep passing me off to other specialists.

I cannot pay another $350 fee to see someone just to tell me they can't help me again. (It's jaw related, so no it's not covered. Oral medicine specialists/oral surgeons etc. are not covered.)

I'm currently residing at Vancouver, British Columbia. During my good days of employment, I had brought a car under financing. Although I'm pretty good with the machine, I was not good with the underlying math in car financing.

Story time:

I hav owned a 2018 Honda Civic for 10% interest paying $385 bi-weekly. After three months of owning this car, I lost my job and I was in situation finding it really hard to pay the installments.

So, just like any other person I went out to see options to   cut down this and walked myself into another evil dealer with my 2018 civic.

Since I was pretty much worried/desperate/helpless at this time; they have pitched me a few cars promising me that my installments would come down to $300 bi weekly saving yourself $200 a month.
I sold to the solution and picked a 2015 Ford focus.

(I signed all the paper works happily thinking I'm saving $200 bucks now)

After six months of using this car, i realised that the dealer have locked me up for a whooping 19% interest on this car.
This is the most ridiculous rates one could ever get in Vancouver for a 2015 car.

Right now, I feel terribly stupid and helpless thinking that I could do nothing at this point. Also I feel ashmed of being fooled around by the sales person for his selling tactics.

I'm looking for options/tips/suggestions to work on this issue here. 
 
- I want the car and bank loan gone. I know I have made a mistake but I'm day dreaming a life without this to save $600 every month to fly back home and see my parents whom I haven't seen for 5 years now.

- I need to teach the dealer a lesson, something like a slap on their face for fooling around ppl and pushing them into this pit.

point time,1akd4ko,2024-02-06 16:00:12,devtonursing,britishcolumbia,Not sure if it's the right financial decision: switching to nursing from software development,"Hey all, I feel like I'm going through a life crisis where my life has no meaning, and I get no fulfillment from what I do, particularly at work. I feel really depressed about it, and it's starting to affect my performance at work.

I'm (30F) a junior software developer earning around $78,000 and working from home most days. Before that I worked as an IT technician in various roles. The job has a good work-life balance and is easily my best job so far. I get great benefits, too. It's helping me pay off my debt at a reasonable pace.

However, I don't feel fulfilled in it. All I'm doing is making software that makes my company millions. It gives me no purpose. I thought about what would provide me with meaning, and really, it's just the idea of creating a difference in people's lives and helping them get better. I talk to computers all day at work with little human interaction, and on many days, it's a good thing, but sometimes I miss talking to people. I thought about changing jobs, but it's not guaranteed in this current climate, and to be honest, I'm not sure I'd be able to match the salary I have elsewhere at my current level of experience.

I am interested in psychology and decided to become a psychologist or a psychiatric nurse. I went for the latter as it's fewer years in school (vs the Master/PhD I'd have to do for psychology), and I still get to work with the same group of people a psychologist would, just in a different context.

I'm not interested in other nursing areas (I get pale at the sight of blood), so I have been looking to become a Registered Psychiatric Nurse by enrolling in the BSN in Psychiatric Nursing at Douglas College. I know that RPNs can only practice in the western provinces and are not recognized in the East. I see myself staying in BC for the long term, so I'm not too worried about that, but I'm wondering if I should suck it up and take the ""normal"" nursing degree to become an RN and then specialize in psychiatry. Both programs are four years long.

What I'm wondering is if this is a crazy idea. Leaving behind the comfort of my current job for the stress and abuse nurses deal with daily? My mum thinks so and is very much against the idea. She says I should stay as a developer and find meaning elsewhere. My best friend thinks it's a great idea (she's in her final year as a nursing student) and is encouraging me to pursue it.

I would be giving up a lot for those years in school, but there's high demand for RPNs/RNs, so I'm more likely to get a job straight out of college and work my way up from there. The starting pay for nursing is good and with overtime, I could make more if I wanted to. But maybe I'm underestimating the demands of the job. I have seen RPNs do their job from the point of view of a patient before, so I have an idea of what their average day would look like on the floor, but I'm not aware of what else happened behind the scenes.

I just want to be a part of something and to make a difference. To have purpose and meaning in my life. I have struggled with my dark thoughts a lot more recently and I can't switch off this feeling that I'm wasting my life away and I'd come to regret choosing the ""easy"" way over the more rewarding way.

Maybe I'm romanticizing nursing too much because it's what I'm leaning towards. So I'm coming here for advice on what to do. I have applied for admission to the Fall semester to do my pre-requisites. This gives me enough time to determine whether it's the right decision.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1akd4ko/not_sure_if_its_the_right_financial_decision/,34

Every week or so, we’ll highlight a new subreddit where maybe you can **tell us about your favourite restaurant or dive bar or hike in that city/region**. BC has a lot of beautiful areas, let’s explore them a bit!

Today we're combing the twin munis of ***Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge.***

/r/PittMeadows has been a community for 9 years and has about 450 subscribers. /r/MapleRidge has been a community for 12 years and has about 6,600 subscribers. 

IRL, the Municipality of **Maple Ridge**, which originally included the Pitt Meadows area, was incorporated in 1874, and is British Columbia's fifth-oldest municipality. The current population of Maple Ridge is about 100,000.

The region's economy, originally and traditionally inhabited by the Katzie First Nation and Kwantlen First Nation, was first based around logging and agriculture. To this day, forestry remains one of the biggest employers of the region. 

The area was once home to a large Japanese population, as well, with more than 200 Japanese-owned farms in Maple Ridge in the 1920s. Some 300 Japanese Canadian families from Maple Ridge were interned during WW2, and their assets were seized and sold.

IRL **Pitt Meadows** was incorporated in 1914 and has a population of about 20,000. The municipality was originally a part of Maple Ridge, but in 1892 residents of the area petitioned for their removal from the District of Maple Ridge. 

Like Maple Ridge, the economy of Pitt Meadows has long been based in agriculture, to this day. Due to it being more low-lying and prone to flooding than much of Maple Ridge, the region was slower to develop. Over 68% of Pitt Meadows is within a floodplain and 86% of Pitt Meadows is within the BC Agricultural Land Reserve as protected farmland.

People talk about how folks in CMBC make a lot but should we really engage in a race to the bottom. I remember how auto workers in America were told to compromise in 08 and only recently did they get a fair deal. If we want to help everyone let’s support unionizing all sectors supporting worker co-ops. The thing with any power dynamic whether a public service or private never give an inch to the rich they take a mile. I have been surprised of the media coverage of constantly talking about disruptions not about how cost of living has gotten worse and folks deserve a pay increase. If we want to care about cost savings what about all the businesses that write off thousand dollar dinners as tax write offs or vacations or the billions in loopholes for corporations. If we truly care about disruptions then pay people a fair wage indexed to inflation. We should not wait years and then care about workers. We should not let workers start to flight against each other but together in solidarity. Also higher wages means higher economic growth. I rather have transit workers get payed more then some multi millionaires with a dozen investment properties getting a vacation to the bahamas as a tax write off.

Every week, or so, we’ll highlight a new subreddit where maybe you can **tell us about your favourite restaurant or dive bar or hike in that city/region**. BC has a lot of beautiful areas, let’s explore them a bit!

This week we're looking at Surrey! [r/SurreyBC](http://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC) has been a community for 12 years and has about 30,000 subscribers. 

IRL, Surrey is the second largest city in BC with about 680,000 people in 2024, and the eleventh largest city in Canada. Incorporated in 1879, the city encompasses land formerly occupied by a number of Halqemeylem-speaking indigenous groups, including the Semiahmoo, Katzie, and the Kwantlen peoples. It was named by H.J. Brewer who thought the area looked like his native County of Surrey in England. In 2021, nearly 38% of the population was South Asian, 31% were European, 11% East Asian, and 10% Southeast Asian. 17% of *Sasquatch* in Canada own a condo in Surrey. 

Surrey is home to several unique [neighbourhoods](https://discoversurreybc.com/explore/our-neighbourhoods), with access to urban areas, [farms](https://discoversurreybc.com/explore/the-best-of-surrey/our-favourite-u-picks), [nature trails and parks](https://discoversurreybc.com/explore/the-best-of-surrey/our-favourite-secret-gardens) and ocean front and river front land. 

Surrey is one of the largest industrial centres in BC, with a growing high technology, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, health, education, agriculture, and arts sectors. The region has strong roots in agriculture as well.

I've (single F w/3 kids) have been renting a house since 2020. We had pets, I paid a pet deposit, I take GOOD care of my home and there is no damage whatsoever from the time we've been here. BUT, I'm an idiot and decided to get my boys a dog for Christmas 2022, without asking permission from the landlord first.... After the fact, when I finally came to my senses and remembered to ask her, she had no problem with it. She's a dog person, she said all kids should have a dog at least once in their lives. But I didn't get it in writing. Now, (over a year later), she's asking for an increase to the pet deposit and wants me to sign a new lease that ends my tenancy in September so her Mom can move in.

We have been month to month since July 2021. Every change we've made to the original agreement since then has been verbal (me painting accent walls in the bedrooms, removing built-in night stands, landscaping, paying rent in two installments on the 1st and 15th), nothing has been in writing. She increased my rent $300 over Covid because she told me her husband and her were divorcing and we'd have to leave. So I panicked then and asked if there was ""anything we could do"" to be able to stay. She told me I could pay additional rent, and since then I've been paying in two installments per month. I always pay in-full, just not on the first.

Because of all the weird addendums that she asked for, and because of the end date to the new agreement, I told her I'm not going to sign it. Now I feel that's she's going to evict me and my family because of the late payment of rent. I'm so stressed I can't sleep. This economy and rental market is insane, and now because we got a dog I've made it infinitely harder on myself to find another place. I screwed myself, and now I'm heartbroken. I know I f**ked up, but I don't know what to do...

I don't even really need advice. I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening reddit...

**ETA**

-The house is a 5 bedroom house. 
-The landlords mother hadn't been evicted from her place. The landlord stated in a text message that the mother *may* have to move into the house in September. 
-I have the original agreement from 2020. This is the only agreement that I signed. We did not sign any paperwork about the rent increase in 2021.

She has been trying telehealth, in person clinics, calling healthlink, and even calling private clinics and has been constantly getting the runaround. The synopsis is as follows:
- some doctors say she needs a referral to get the testing, but are refusing to provide one
- some doctors say that only your family physician can order that, which we do not have
- Healthlink says that any doctor can provide the referral and that she has to ""just keep trying to find a doctor who is willing to""
- some private clinics require a physician referral, see above.
- other private clinics don't provide the screening as a standalone service, but require you to be a client of their comprehensive packages, which is ludicrously expensive.

We're willing to pay for private testing (usually around $1000) if it can be done standalone, but this is just absurd. She has excellent medical reasons to be requesting this screening but no doctor is listening to her, instead blatantly ignoring the need for this screening.

I was finished by 849AM.

When I left there were only around 5 people waiting behind me.

I'm not sure if I just got lucky, if this particular office is less busy than others, or if maybe it's just a slower time of the year.

*The landlord is responsible to make sure these things are working. These fall under ""repairs"" or ""emergency repairs"" and are ""essential"".  Try to work out a deal with landlord for out-of-pocket expenses. If not satisfied with that, file for a monetary order to be reimbursed. Show the arbitrator a timeline of events, receipts.

Today, i received a call from the clinic saying that I have a pending payment for 170CAD for my ""appointment"" with the doctor, which was effectively a 5 min call where he  agreed to be my family doctor, and advised me to get a PAP smear. I informed him that I am waiting for my MSP to start, to which he confirmed that my account already had an MSP number and it looked active to him. 
I checked on my account on the clinic website and there are no pending bills. There was no intimation about the billing amount or charges anywhere on the website or in any email communication, since my first inquiry. 

I raised this up with the person who called me today, and she incorrectly mentioned that the details are in the emails, and when i refuted the information after checking, she hung up on me. 

I am very confused and just looking for advice on how to proceed, and if I need to do something about this from my end. 

PS - I have a travel insurance from BCAA for the 2 months while i wait for my MSP to get active.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1afxegw/need_advice_on_potential_medical_billing/,6

Every week, or so, we’ll highlight a new subreddit where maybe you can **tell us about your favourite restaurant or dive bar or hike in that city/region**. BC has a lot of beautiful areas, let’s explore them a bit!

A few quick facts:

[r/Revelstoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/Revelstoke/) has been a community for 12 years and has about 2,000 members. 

IRL, Revelstoke is a city in southeastern BC, with a census population of about 8,000 in 2023, is situated on the banks of the Columbia River just south of the Revelstoke Dam and near its confluence with the Illecillewaet River. It is located in the world’s only inland temperate rainforest.

Revelstoke is on the territory of the Sinixt First Nation. The Secwepemc, Ktunaxa, and Syilx First Nations also have traditional land use in this region.

Revelstoke was founded in the 1880s when the Canadian Pacific Railway was built through the area. Mining was an important early industry in the regions' development. The name was originally Farwell, after a local land owner and surveyor. Previous to that it was knowns as the the Second Crossing, to differentiate it from the first crossing of the Columbia River by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Donald.

 The city was named by the Canadian Pacific Railway after Lord Revelstoke, head of Baring Brothers & Co., the UK investment bank that, in partnership with Glyn, Mills & Co., saved the Canadian Pacific Railway from bankruptcy in the summer of 1885 by buying the company's unsold bonds, enabling the railway to reach completion. The post office dates from 1886.

The construction of the Trans-Canada Highway in 1962 further eased access to the region, and since then tourism has been an important feature of the local economy, with skiing having emerged as the most prominent attraction. Mount Revelstoke National Park is just north of the town. 

Revelstoke was once one of the largest and most prominent communities in the interior of the province, mostly due to its importance as a railway centre. Steamboat traffic from the south connected with the Canadian Pacific Railway making this an important transportation center. While we no longer see steamboat traffic up the Columbia, those industries are still a big part in the economy and personality of the area. Revelstoke is home to the Revelstoke Dam, one of the largest generators of power in BC.

poverty,1ashgr0,2024-02-16 19:37:39,orlybatman,britishcolumbia,Discriminatory policies towards low-income disabled BC residents,"As everyone is likely aware of, BC has a disability assistance program which provides low-income disabled residents with monthly financial support. For a single person this comes out to approximately $1,500/month.

To qualify for disability assistance, an individual would need to be disabled in some way, as well as fall within the asset and income limits. Asset limits for a single person are $100,000. Meanwhile they can have an income of up to $16,200 before it begins to decrease the support at a dollar-for-dollar rate. So for example, if someone on disability assistance were to earn $25,000 through work, they would receive $8,800 less in assistance for that year. After an income of approximately $34,500 the individual would receive no support.

However what many people **don't** know is that individuals on disability assistance are not allowed to earn any interest on their savings. Zero.

Interest is classified by the ministry as ""unearned income"", and it results in a clawing back of an equal amount from the person's support.

So if someone were to invest $10,000 of their savings into a TFSA or GIC, resulting in say... $500 in interest over the course of the year, as soon as they receive that interest they would need to declare it to the ministry, and their next month's check will be $500 less.

The only way they are permitted to earn any money from investments or interest at all is if their money is held in an authorized trust. This costs around $1,000-1,200 to set up, and requires a trustee to oversee the funds.

This is a rather discriminatory policy towards low-income disabled BC citizens that robs them of hundreds, or even potentially thousands of dollars every year. Everyone in BC can invest their savings, and in fact it is recommended that they do so in order to prepare themselves for retirement. Yet the BC government decided that a demographic among the highest risk of poverty should not be permitted to do the same.

The province is constantly under pressure to raise support rates, since they are inadequate given the current costs of living, yet they refuse to take a step that would better the lives of low-income disabled individuals while costing the province absolutely nothing.

As someone who was put on disability assistance a few years back, and who has lost out on thousands due to this policy, I would urge you to write your local MLA's and ask them to change this discriminatory policy. It would be immediately helpful for many disabled people currently trapped in poverty.",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1ashgr0/discriminatory_policies_towards_lowincome/,0

My girlfriend and I signed a lease for our current house with the landlord and found 2 roommates to share the place with us, one was a friend and the other was from Facebook. Since the roommates were not on the lease, upon moving in we had them sign a Roommate Agreement. The agreement has the following line:  


>Any Roommate intending to end his or her occupation or tenancy will inform the remaining Roommates, in writing, a minimum of 60 days before vacating the Premises. Whenever possible, the vacating Roommate will reasonably assist the remaining Roommate(s) in finding a suitable replacement Roommate. The vacating Roommate will be responsible for any and all current and outstanding charges, costs, or fees incurred by him or her during the course of his or her occupation or tenancy, or caused as a result of the vacation of his or her occupation or tenancy.

We are only 4 months into the lease and on Feb 9th, my friend told me that he is moving out because he is having trouble saving and wants to find a cheaper place. He believes that he is only obligated to give me 1 month notice and that if we don't find someone to take his place for March 1st, he doesn't need to pay. I believe that since he signed that he'd give 60 day notice and is ""*responsible for any and all current and outstanding charges, costs, or fees incurred by him or her during the course of his or her occupation or tenancy, or caused as a result of the vacation of his or her occupation or tenancy*."", that he'd be obligated to pay for March's rent if he can't find someone to take his room.  


There is a line in the agreement that says ""not being a good rock climber"" is one of the reasons someone can get kicked out. We added this in as a little joke and he thinks that because of this, the whole agreement is worthless and he doesn't need to abide by it.  


Am I correct here, or is my friend?",https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1asia0u/roommate_leaving_before_the_end_of_the_lease/,1

Hey all, 

Some background context:

My wife and I live at the end of a townhouse complex and we live right beside another townhouse complex that has a park. It is fenced off, however there is an opening to the park with no gate. 

 My wife is pregnant and due to the snow/weather, she took our two dogs for a quick walk this morning to the neighbouring park just to let them out (quick and easy). When she was leaving, one of the home owners in the complex began yelling at her asking if she lived here and that she is “not allowed” in their park. My wife, felt awful and apologized and tried explaining that we live right next to the park etc. but the guy just ended up doubling down on her. 

We have kids/families from our complex utilizing the park all the time. I’m not sure what the legality is around utilizing the park. There’s no signs that state private property. I’m assuming maybe it was the fact that we brought our dogs which is what triggered the guy?

Obviously we’re aren’t going to use the park anymore (today was a one off for us) but I’m just curious to know if anyone has any insight or experience to a situation like this. I’d like to go have a conversation with the guy. 

I was looking in the BC government website, but couldn’t find anything specific in this nature.

I was covered at 80% with Canada Life before the drug I take ($2,700 monthly) was added to the Pharmacare list in October. Now Canada Life says they only have to cover 50% and Pharmacare will pay the other 30% after I apply. When I applied to Pharmacare, they sent a letter saying my deductible was $4,500 (equivalent of six months out of pocket) because of my income but Canada Life says their policy is that Pharmacare is my primary insurance if I’m eligible for the program (regardless of deductible) so it’s not their problem. 

I wish Pharmacare had rejected me or there was an option for people with private insurance and higher incomes to be exempted from Pharmacare because I now will end up paying $11,000 instead $6,000 out of pocket because Canada Life is using Pharamcare as an excuse not to cover me at the rate for my plan. 

Any ideas? This seems like a major downside to Pharmacare that maybe hasn’t been considered? I can imagine almost everyone with decent private insurance and expensive drug needs will be in the same boat if their drug is added to Pharmacare. It also puts a higher burden on the province instead of private corporations who are paid to provide insurance - wtf?

I have a close relative, a Canadian citizen, who has a condo in North Vancouver that he's owned for about 20 years. He is going to be living (and earning his income) in the US for the foreseeable future, and the plan was hatched to rent it to me in his absence. 

Then we discover that, under the terms of the speculation tax for owners residing outside the country, I am a ""non-arms length tenant,"" and that I would have to have an income of at least 3 times annual fair market rent to satisfy the requirements to exempt the owner from the tax - a threshold that my income does not currently meet.

Uh, what?

Why does the government, or anyone else, care whether he rents it to a stranger or a relative? The net gain of one more rental unit in the market will be exactly the same, will it not? The apartment that I currently inhabit will become available for someone else.

That specific income requirement is particularly galling. Non-arms length tenancies are acceptable for well-off people, but not for mere peasants like myself? What's the logic in that?

Is there something we're missing here? Has anyone navigated a way around those provisions in a situation like this?

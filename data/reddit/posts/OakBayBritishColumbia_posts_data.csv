We're not from Victoria and are looking for any feedback on the camp. Has anyone gone to the camp or heard anything about it? 

(By the way, I've tried asking this question on r/VictoriaBC, but my post has been held by the moderators for nearly a week and I can't reach the moderators.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/OakBayBritishColumbia/comments/19bekl9/smus_summer_volleyball_camp/,2

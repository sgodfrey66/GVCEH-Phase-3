I am currently collecting participants for a study regarding the impact of adverse childhood experiences and the associated psychological variables. Participation includes electronically completing various questionnaires, which are used to gather information about basic demographics (age, gender, etc.), as well as several scales addressing adverse childhood experiences, mental health, and associated psychological variables. Participation in this study would take approximately 25 minutes in total and is COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL.

The following link contains the survey: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BZ7C2LN](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BZ7C2LN) 

If you have any questions, please contact liamaoki99@gmail.com",https://www.reddit.com/r/SaanichPeninsula/comments/1akej76/seeking_research_participants/,0

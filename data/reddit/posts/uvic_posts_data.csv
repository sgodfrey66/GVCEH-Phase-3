At this time, snow is falling in many parts of Greater Victoria, then expected to turn to rain after midnight, with temperatures rising.

Based on this information and early morning on-campus assessments tomorrow, we will make a decision before 7 a.m. on whether the campus will open at its regular time or if we may need to delay opening. Please check [www.uvic.ca](http://www.uvic.ca/) for updates.

Honestly, I’ve been seeing a lot of negative posts regarding uvic lately that have been making me rethink a bit so I would love to hear some honest opinions on whether it’s worth coming there.
I am  finishing my senior year , I live on mainland B.C (Would need a ferry to move here),and would be majoring in humanities if any of that makes a difference at all.
This is quite important to me because if I come to study here I would need to move pretty far from home and I wouldn’t have family or friends there.

violence,19cs4rm,2024-01-22 09:50:43,tiogar99,uvic,It's time to fix our student union (petition),"**TL;DR: UVSS broken, sign** [**petition**](https://forms.gle/hhEPcWekue4pRhUXA) **below to try and fix it.**

&#x200B;

I've been in student advocacy and government at UVic for a while, and throughout that time I've watched our undergrad student union (the UVSS) get steadily worse and worse. There are a lot of reasons for that, such as the near-complete lack of accountability in the organization, directors working unmanageable positions that make zero sense, and a failure to train and prepare students for governance roles in the union (For more information see the [governance review](https://uvss.ca/governance/) completed last year).

But over the last year **we've hit a critical point**. Staff turnover is has gotten ridiculous: in the last year, **every single senior manager in the organization has left, but one,** following the previous year where two senior managers quit. Entire organizational units have come and gone too, such as the entire Anti-Violence Project staff. Basic, mandated tasks aren't getting done, like updating the website with agendas and minutes from board meetings. Our student paper, the Martlet, no longer really reports on the UVSS. I've been told that is because of the union's long-established strategy of making veiled and  legal threats against critics.

There isn't any easy way out of the spiral; organizational change is slow and difficult at the best of times. Despite this, I think we have to try. I've drafted [this motion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B_a0O3G0r6puvUhugxUY47kKffqp-BbSdxTpQtSr83Y/edit?usp=sharing) to implement what I think are the most important recommendations from the governance review: the implementation of the 'policy governance framework', the 'one-staff model', fairer compensation for Non-Lead Directors, and a neutral chair for board meetings. These basically boil down to changing the structure of the UVSS so there is one staff member that can be held responsible by the Board for ALL operations of the society, and making it so the board is all about governance (changing policies and making sure the organization is moving in the right direction) rather than management (directly dealing with staff and running programs). This is to ensure accountability and continuity.

If this petition reaches the required signatures today, I'll take it to the February general meeting.

Also: I'll do my best to answer questions about this below, so don't hesitate to ask.

If it hasn't reached you yet, below is the message that is going out.** 

\--

We recognize that many of you were affected by system challenges yesterday while applying for housing for 2024-25. We are very sorry. We heard you loud and clear; improvement to this process is needed. 

If you were in the application process and you received a “time out” message, rest assured we are working with the start of your application time and not the completion time. We hope this alleviates any concerns for those that were disconnected from the application mid-process. 

We anticipated challenges with the system due to a maximum number of users that can be in our software’s application process at one time. We attempted to advise you by email on January 29th that an error message would be likely. Unfortunately, we did not anticipate the sheer volume of current residents that would attempt to apply at one time and just how many of you would get the “service temporarily unavailable” message. We also did not expect the application process to be dramatically slowed down for those of you that were mid-application during this time. On behalf of Residences Services, we apologize for these frustrations. 

If you’ve submitted your application in its entirety, you will have received an email confirmation. Alternatively, in the housing portal, there is an application status page that is viewable to students who have a completed application, which includes your application start and submit time. If you are still unsure if you have completed your application or if you have any other questions regarding the application process, please contact [resadmin@uvic.ca](mailto:resadmin@uvic.ca). We are doing our best to respond as quickly as possible to inquiries.

We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback through social media, phone calls and emails. It will be used to improve experiences moving forward.

I'm considering transferring to UVIC for engineering (from sfu engineering), for a better social life and to be more independent.

I got good grades in high school and last year I applied to UVIC and got 2 entrance scholarships (about 6k I think), but I didn't accept them.. is it likely I'll be able to get them again? And if I apply for application based scholarships will I be considered based on my high school grades & extra-curriculars?

Also, is the engineering program here any good? I've heard talk about how UVIC is more well known as an Arts & social sciences school.. is that true? And how is student life here? Is it easy to integrate and find a group of friends, find housing, activities to do?

housing,198c9qb,2024-01-16 20:00:01,isyouzi,uvic,UVic Parking 101,"I've had a good amount of interaction with the parking officers to gather some information ever since I entered the school with a car. UVic parking rules and lot arrangements are very confusing - if not completely nonsense in some cases.

So, I'll post the ultimate tutorial for parking in school here. 

NOTE: The post is about parking rules rather than questions like ""which lot should I go to after 10 AM"".

**- Permits**

If you're going to school regularly behind the wheels, buying a monthly permit is your best bet.

General parking permits only allows you to park in general spots. But the definition of ""general spots"" can be very confusing. **You can receive citations even if you are on a permit**, if you parked in the wrong spot. The flex 25 pass and the weekly pass grant you the same rights as the general permit.

Reserved permits allow you to park in the reserved spots. Students should avoid reserved spots as they are mostly there for the campus staff. Reserved spots are mostly within the ring road but there are exceptions.

Accessible parking is cheaper and allows you to park in any spots except the commercial ones (loading zones, etc). But you will be cited if you didn't display the official placard in your car.

**- Lots**

4 types of lot are present in UVic Campus.

* General Lots: These are marked by a number and they are within the campus but outside the ring road.
* Reserved Lots: These are marked by a single alphabet letter and they are within the ring road.
* Value Lots: They are outside the campus and you need to walk for a good while to get to your class.
* Family Housing Spaces: They are reserved spots for the residents paying an annual fee.

**- Spots**

5 types of spots appear in parking lots. Note that the type of spots doesn't always match the type of lots they are in.

TLDR: 

All spots outside the ring road are general spots, unless marked reserved / accessible or controlled by a meter.

All spots inside the ring road are reserved spots, unless marked general.

&#x200B;

* General Spots

Most unmarked spaces outside the ring road are general spots, but be aware of any markings or parking meters nearby. 

They can be seen in reserved lots. There are a few rows of general spots in Lot E (within ring road), for example.

General Spots in the Value Lots can be used with a value pass or a general pass. Value pass does not grant access to general lots.

&#x200B;

* Reserved Spots

Reserved Spots can be used on a reserved permit or an accessible permit, but **DO NOT assume** that they only appear within the ring road!

There are some reserved spots in Lot 4, for example. And if you parked there with your general permit, you'll get cited. This happens almost all the time when I walk pass those spaces.

Watch out for ground paintings and plates hanging nearby. Reserve spots outside the ring road are usually arranged in rows.

&#x200B;

* Short Term Spots

The parking spaces with a meter behind is not covered by your general permit. You will have to pay on the meter even if you are on a permit. You'll get cited if the meter expires.

In some locations they are really hard to recognize. Sometimes another car parks on the nearby spot and it is very possible that this car blocks your sight and you are not aware of the existence of the meter. Always check the back of your car before you leave it in the lot. 

&#x200B;

* Accessible Spots

Usually the closest spot to the walkable exit will be marked as an accessible spot. Only an accessible pass grants you access to it. If it's also a short term spot, you can also park in it with your placard without a permit but remember to pay the meter.

&#x200B;

**- Parking Portal**

UVic is public space, so the general lots are open to the public. Signing up in the parking portal as a guest or a student doesn't really make a difference, outside maybe when you need to appeal a citation, your school email makes it easier.

If you need to sign up as a student, you'll have to provide the parking officer a request to register you in the database.

Most actions like registering vehicles, buying permits and paying citations, can be done in the parking portal.

**- Citations**

You get a yellow citation ticket when you parked in the wrong spots or at the wrong time.

If it is your first citation, you can write to the parking office with a good reason and they'll void it for you, unless it's a really bad offense (which will likely boot your car).

Second time or more, just pay it ASAP. Appealing will just be a waste of time in most cases unless you have solid evidences.

In case there are some really unfortunate errors, like you parked your car at 10:00, walked to your classroom and bought a permit at 10:30 but got a citation at 10:20. These are generally understandable and you should contact the parking office to get your citation voided.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uvic/comments/198c9qb/uvic_parking_101/,52

At UVic, the application portal has never allowed him to submit his transcripts until, I believe, February 15th, which makes the process months behind that of other universities he is considering.

first peoples victoria,1adbq8d,2024-01-28 20:08:19,HiTork,uvic,"Camosun Engineering Bridge and applying within five years of graduation of a technologist diploma, or later","So I'm not sure if this is a question anyone can answer, and arguably, the question is probably more suited for the Camosun sub, but it is tiny with less than 800 people on it.  

When you are applying to one of Camosun's Engineering Bridge programs, one of the stipulations is that in order to apply, you must have completed the associated diploma program within five years of applying to the Bridge program.  My question is just how stingy or strict on their definition of ""five years"" is.  For instance, the five year mark for me will be late April of this year, if I were to apply now, I would still be within the deadline of that five year window, but if I were to apply in May, I wouldn't be.  

The other thing at hand is I believe the Bridge program does not work on a first come, first serve basis and they wait until the last day and when everyone has their transcripts in before they start making a decision.  Since this happens in June for the bridge program into UVic, this would technically put me at over five years if they were to make the decision then.  

I am aware you can send a letter of intent documenting your work history and professional development if it has been more than five years, but my issue is that I don't think at the moment my five years look that great thanks to Covid and a lay off.  Futhermore, my work history was more of a technician oriented role than a technologist one.  In other words, I don't know if a letter would look that great to Camosun/UBC/UVic.  

I already applied to the Bridge to UBC because their deadline is in March which would put me in at just under five years.  I kind of feel like this is my last chance to get into the Bridge program without having to write a letter of intent, which as I described above I don't know if they would accept.  

What I'm hoping is the definition of ""within five years of application"" means the actual date you send in that application.  For example, if I were to have sent in my application to the UBC Bridge back last September when they first opened, I would be well within five years.

I have a fairly high GPA from my program at SAIT and I think the probability is high I could land at Camosun easily (I could be wrong, though), so I am hoping I can do it on grades alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uvic/comments/1adbq8d/camosun_engineering_bridge_and_applying_within/,6

The fact that this wasn’t taken into consideration when the administration made this decision is a huge problem and I very clearly expressed that to him.

> I also brought up the idea of the university addressing damages of the folks who were negatively impacted like this, like [getting] hit by a car. There’s a big long situation there with insurance. I’m not sure how that works, he wasn’t sure how that works, but I made it very clear that in terms of note takers (or other fee-based accommodations) that might need to be paid for, those fees need to be waived for victims.

> The last thing we wrapped up with in the conversation was a plan forward: how to deal with this situation and similar situations that could come up in the future. What we landed on is [that] it’s always better to be safe than sorry. It’s always better to be on the side of accessibility. It’s always good to be on the side of thinking of folks who use public transit.

> Rather than leaning on “when in doubt, open the university”, it might be “when in doubt, keep the university closed”. Whether that’s cancel classes entirely or move them online will be a discussion for the future and a discussion that I’m probably going to leave up to the university.

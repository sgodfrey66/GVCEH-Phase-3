If it hasn't reached you yet, below is the message that is going out.** 

\--

We recognize that many of you were affected by system challenges yesterday while applying for housing for 2024-25. We are very sorry. We heard you loud and clear; improvement to this process is needed. 

If you were in the application process and you received a “time out” message, rest assured we are working with the start of your application time and not the completion time. We hope this alleviates any concerns for those that were disconnected from the application mid-process. 

We anticipated challenges with the system due to a maximum number of users that can be in our software’s application process at one time. We attempted to advise you by email on January 29th that an error message would be likely. Unfortunately, we did not anticipate the sheer volume of current residents that would attempt to apply at one time and just how many of you would get the “service temporarily unavailable” message. We also did not expect the application process to be dramatically slowed down for those of you that were mid-application during this time. On behalf of Residences Services, we apologize for these frustrations. 

If you’ve submitted your application in its entirety, you will have received an email confirmation. Alternatively, in the housing portal, there is an application status page that is viewable to students who have a completed application, which includes your application start and submit time. If you are still unsure if you have completed your application or if you have any other questions regarding the application process, please contact [resadmin@uvic.ca](mailto:resadmin@uvic.ca). We are doing our best to respond as quickly as possible to inquiries.

We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback through social media, phone calls and emails. It will be used to improve experiences moving forward.

Here's why (speaking from a SENG perspective):

* You have opportunities with companies through the co-op program that are *much* harder to get once you graduate.  For example, employment/experience (and resulting post-grad opportunities) with Microsoft, Google, Twitter, etc. are much easier to achieve on a co-op term than they are for a new graduate without that experience.

* If you decrease the course load* from the prescribed 6 academic classes/semester to the ""normal"" 5 classes/semester it will only delay your graduation by two-ish semesters (from 48/6 to 48/5), and will probably make your university experience a *lot* more fun and manageable.

* There is a ton of information thrown at you in engineering, and taking your time to get through the program helps you to absorb it all, and allows for you to work on some meaningful side projects with your extra ""free time"" (ha)

* Use the extra time to join some clubs and do some networking.  Relationships are everything.  If you get your head down and just burn through a degree and come out with no life lessons/experiences, you may regret it.  The ""best"" companies want the best candidates, and the best candidates are well rounded individuals with sound technical ability - not socially awkward nerds who did their degree in record time...

> *Note:  If you **do** deviate from the prescribed schedule (as I recommend you do), just make sure that you're figuring out your class schedule waaaay in advance so that your prerequisites all line up as you need them to.  Some classes in engineering are only offered once a year, so if it's a prerequisite for another class, and you miss that year's offering of it due to poor planning - you're in a tough spot (ask me how I know).

I ask this because I don't see why the UVSS would need to raise fees by $10 over 5 years with a direct raise of $5, which at minimum would result in next year having $180,000 based on only Fall and Spring with 18,000 students not counting the addition increases or students paying over the summer as well.

They claim it would go to ""sub operation in order to keep prices low, services at their best quality and to pay our staff a fair and competitive wage"".

I go the sub often and the prices are fine as is, if you are really hurting for cash grad lounge has a $4 meal that's good value but I digress. Services seem to be at their best already, and I don't know enough about the wages of the staff but I haven't heard any complaints about the wages. 

So if everything is currently fine with the fees currently, why do we need to raise them and has the board looked at alternatives revenue sources (donations/sponsorships)?

If this is for future proofing, then why are you robbing students now so that future students don't need to run another referendum?

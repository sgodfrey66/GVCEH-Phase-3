      "\n",
      ">Thank you Graeme for outlining the breakdown of Ministries and positions with interest in this property.\n",
      ">We have received direction (since your previous email) from Stephanie Melvin that the Campers are to be left alone and that they are not asking for any assistance at this time from the VicPD.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Ms, Melvin confirmed for me that this direction has come directly from ADM Cavanaugh.\n",
      "\n",
      ">We have communicated our concern to ADM Cavanaugh that things could escalate if allowed to continue on the property without any form of management. We have asked to open a dialogue with her and have offered our assistance in developing a strategy to deal with the current situation and to assist with developing plans moving forward concerning the management of the greenspace as it relates to the homeless population.\n",
      "\n",
      ">For example, every morning when the VicPD awaken homeless persons in the parks this provides us with opportunities to assess many things such as their exposure level to the elements, mental health status, physical health status, and many other vulnerabilities. We connect them at these times with mental health teams, connect them with housing providers, at times take them to hospital, or call the ambulance if they need immediate medical attention, in addition to that, because they are on City property, the Parks Department comes and deans up accumulated garbage, needles, and human waste. The public works department then hauls all of that away to be disposed of properly.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Because the space they currently occupy is not on City property none of that management outlined above is happening. In effect, if the people there are allowed to continue to occupy the space, unabated, unrestrained and unmanaged it will be akin to actually creating greater vulnerabilities for them. The likelihood of an assault, overdose, exposure or other incident occurring increases as the population grows without arty form of management.\n",
      "\n",
      ">One other point that was communicated to ADM Cavanaugh through Ms. Melvin was that there is green space in City Parks available all over the City. The people that are taking shelter on the grounds of the Courthouse are not doing so because there is nowhere for them to go. it is our experienced belief that they are taking up sheltering on that space because they are not being compelled to pack up every morning and move off the grounds.\n",
      ">As we have communicated our concerns to ADM Cavanaugh in writing the VicPD, respectfully will not be taking any action until we have received a response from her directly.\n",
      ">May I ask whether there has been communication between the two Ministries you've outlined below with respect to this issue been initiated?\n",

      "At approximately 12:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon an off-duty VicPD officer was volunteering her time to walk a dog in the 500-block of David Street when she was randomly approached by an unknown woman. The woman was agitated and acting erratically, and accused the officer of stealing the dog she was walking. The woman then physically attacked the off-duty officer. A struggle ensued that went to the ground and the suspect struck the officer several times, including violently kicking the officer several times while she was on the ground. The suspect then fled the area.\n",

This is founded in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that every person has the right to liberty and the presumption of innocence pre-trial.  Police are also asked to consider the circumstances of Indigenous or vulnerable person in the process, in order to address the disproportionate impacts that the criminal justice system has on these populations.\n",

I just want to remind everyone that City Councils are basically all powerful on housing change in Victoria and the surrounding municipalities.

There is no housing growth without these being upzoned and allowing walkups, townhouses, etc. Demand is steadily increasing while supply stays the same. \n",
